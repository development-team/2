 * changed the code to use the linkgrammar version 4.5.8 and relex version 1.1.1
 * change the relex method invoked by ParseCorpus to printRelationsAlt, which returns a more adequate relex format.
 * change RelFileReader (which reads relex input) and ParseCorpus (which generates relex output) to accept the unary.
 entries of relex from the printRelatoinsAlt. Now, entries likd det(the) and adj(good) are accepted.
 * create the Server class to use NLGen as a daemon.
