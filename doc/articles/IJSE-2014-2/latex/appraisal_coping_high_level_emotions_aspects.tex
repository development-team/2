\abstract{Turing genius anticipated current research in AI field for 65 years and stated that idea of intelligent machines "cannot be wholly ignored, because the idea of 'intelligence' is itself emotional rather than mathematical" \cite{intelligent_machinery}.
This is second article dedicated to emotional thinking bases. In first article we \cite{computational_emotional_thinking} created overall picture and proposed framework for computational emotional thinking. We used 3 bases for our work: AI - six thinking levels model described in book "The emotion machine" \cite{emotionmachine}. Evolutionary psychology model: "Wheel of emotions" \cite{natureofemotions}. Neuroscience (neurotransmission) theory of emotions by L\"{o}vheim "Cube of emotions" \cite{cubeofemotions}. Based on neurotransmitters impact we proposed to model emotional computing systems. Current work is dedicated to three aspects left not described in first article: \emph{appraisal}: algorithm and predicates - how inbound stimulus is estimated to trigger proper emotional response, \emph{coping}: the way human treat with emotional state triggered by stimulus appraisal and further thinking processes, \emph{high level emotions} impact on system and its computational processes.\\
