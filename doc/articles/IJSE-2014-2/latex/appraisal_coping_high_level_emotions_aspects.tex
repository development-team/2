\abstract{Turing genius anticipated current research in AI field for 65 years and stated that idea of intelligent machines "cannot be wholly ignored, because the idea of 'intelligence' is itself emotional rather than mathematical" \cite{intelligent_machinery}.
Our work is dedicated to construction or synthesis of computational emotional thinking.
We used 3 bases for our work: AI - six thinking levels model described in book "The emotion machine" \cite{emotionmachine}. Evolutionary psychology model of emotions that is called "Wheel of emotions" \cite{natureofemotions}, we used as subjective perception model. Neuroscience (neurotransmission) theory of emotions by L\"{o}vheim "Cube of emotions" \cite{cubeofemotions} was used as objective brain emotional response model. Based on neurotransmitters impact we propose to model emotional computing systems. Overall presented work is synthesis of several emotional/affective theories to produce a model of emotions and affective mechanisms that fit model of six thinking levels architecture.\\
