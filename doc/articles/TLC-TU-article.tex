\section{Introduction}
In 2006 year Marvin Minsky has published his book “The Emotion Machine” where he provides model of human thinking dividing all actions into 3 categories:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Critic
 \item Selector
 \item Way To Think
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Critic}
Critic could be understood as probabilistic predicate. In real world when human faces with the problem several critics are activated. In ITSM domain, for example, when auto generated incident comes to queue Auto Generated Incident critic will be activated. After activating critic becomes Selector. From another point of view activated Critic is a Selector
For example:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Learned Reactive Critics.
 \item Deliberative Critics.
 \item Reflective Critics.
 \item Self-Reflective Critics.
 \item Self-Conscious Critics.
\end{enumerate}
