\begin{abstract}
How can we make machines actually feel emotions? Is there any option to make AI suffer, feel happiness, love, aggression, contempt, awe? Before we could find proper answer to this question we should take in account several aspects: philosophical, psychological, neurophysiological and cognitive architecture combine these theories. We propose mapping of neuromodulators on computational processes that could be used as framework for affective computation based on L\"{o}vheim ``Cube of emotions'' \cite{cubeofemotions} , Plutchik ``Wheel of emotions'' \cite{natureofemotions}, Tomkins ``Theory of affects'' \cite{primer_affect_psychology} and combine this theories in the cognitive architecture of ``The emotion machine'' by Marvin Minsky \cite{emotionmachine}. In other words we propose a mechanism of affects (emotions) as neuromodulatory influence on computational processes.\\
