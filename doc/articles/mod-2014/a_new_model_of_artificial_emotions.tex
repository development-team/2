\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
How can we make machines actually feel emotions? Is there any option to make AI suffer, feel happiness, love, aggression, contempt, awe? Before we could find proper answer to this question we should be take in account several aspects: philosophical, psychological as overall picture of low level and high level subjective emotions, neurophysiological as low level objective mechanism of brain response and cognitive architecture to put all these approaches in. We propose framework for affective computation implementation in computational spiking neurons based on L\"{o}vheim ``Cube of emotions'' \cite{cubeofemotions} , Plutchik ``Wheel of emotions'' \cite{natureofemotions}, Tomkins ``Theory of affects'' \cite{primer_affect_psychology} and combine this theories in the cognitive architecture environment of ``The emotion machine'' by Marvin Minsky \cite{emotionmachine}. We propose mechanisms of emotions influence on computational processes via neuromodulation.\\
