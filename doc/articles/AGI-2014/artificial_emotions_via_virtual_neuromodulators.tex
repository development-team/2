This article is dedicated to theoretical framework of emotional thinking based on.

Before we could find proper answer to this question we should be take in account several aspects: psychological as overall picture of low level and high level subjective emotions, neurophysiological as low level objective mechanism of brain response and cognitive architecture to put this theories in.\\
