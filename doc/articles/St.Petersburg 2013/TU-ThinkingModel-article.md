#Thinking model and machine understanding of English primitive texts and it's application in Infrastructure as Service domain.

## Abstract
Construction of machine understanding is definitely the challenge. There are several technologies used widely.
Currently mainstream applications uses machine operatable knowledge bases, for example Wolfram Alpha to support simple dialog and operate devices.
Newer the less those approaches do not answer the question how do machine could be capable to understand human created text.
We tried new approach based on assumption that human understanding is tightly coupled with human thinking itself.
We used thinking model described in Marvin Minsky book "The emotion machine".
