\abstract{Our work is dedicated to construction or synthesis of computational emotional thinking model.
We used 4 basis for our work: AI - six thinking levels model described in book "The emotion machine" \cite{emotionmachine}. Evolutionary psychology model of emotions that is called "Wheel of emotions"\cite{natureofemotions}, we used as subjective perception model. Neuroscience(neurotransmission) theory of emotions by L\"{o}vheim "Cube of emotions"\cite{cubeofemotions} was used as objective brain emotional response model. Based on neurotransmitters impact we propose to model emotional computing systems. Overall presented work is synthesis of several emotional/affective theories to produce model of emotions and affective mechanisms that fit model of six thinking levels architecture.\\
