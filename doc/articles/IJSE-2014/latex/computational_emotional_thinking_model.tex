\abstract{Our work is dedicated to construction or synthesis of computational emotional thinking model.
We used 4 basis for our work: AI - six thinking levels model described in book "The emotion machine" \cite{emotionmachine}. Evolutionary psychology model of emotions that is called "Wheel of emotions", we used as subjective perception model. Neuroscience(neurotransmission) theory of emotions by Lovheim "Cube of emotions" was used as objective brain emotional response model. Based on neurotransmitters impact we propose to model emotional computing systems. Overall presented work is synthesis of several emotional/affective theories to produce model of emotions and affective mechanisms that fit model of six thinking levels architecture.\\
