#Artificial emotions and appraisal aspects

##Introduction

Latest biggest neural network was build by RIKEN and contains 1.73 billion nerve cells connected by 10.4 trillion synapses [Riken]. Their simulation represented only 1 percent of brain. We still far away from really functional model of the brain, especially taking in account the energy it consumed and the place it occupied. There are other team that promise to create the new base for the electronic simulations of brain: IBM initiative SyNAPSE [SyNAPSE].
