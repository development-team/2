#Artificial emotions and appraisal aspects

##Introduction

Latest biggest neural network was build by RIKEN and contains 1.73 billion nerve cells connected by 10.4 trillion synapses [Riken]. Their simulation represented only 1 percent of brain. We still far away from really functional model of the brain, especially taking in account the energy it consumed and the place it occupied. There are other team that promise to create the new base for the electronic simulations of brain: IBM initiative SyNAPSE [SyNAPSE]. This initiatives crates background and demands proper theoretical basis for new thinking machines.
Recently the scientific interest to emotional aspect of thinking raised in following domains:

Emotions are in focus of a lot of researchers from neuro-scientists [emotionsbraintorobot, parsingreward, neuromodulatory, cubeofemotions, natureofemotions], to computer science specialists[emotionandsociable, senticcomputing, hourglass, affectivemodelofinterplay, affectivecomputing], and emotional intelligence(EQ) becomes important, at least not less than IQ. There were only some computational emotions models created[computationalmodelsemotion, computationalmodelsemotionscognition, evaluatingcomutationalmodel, threelevel] and we failed to find computational emotion thinking model already created.
