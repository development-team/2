\begin{abstract}
In this article we propose the approach to make a computing system feel the emotions. In practice, we created the approach to manage processes of computational system via artificial emotional states. We used virtual neuromodulators as main low level base for the emotional mechanisms and mapped their levels on computing system parameters. Our hypothesis is based mainly on L\"{o}vheim ``Cube of emotions'' \cite{cubeofemotions} as neurobiological emotional mechanism, Plutchik ``Wheel of emotions'' \cite{natureofemotions} and Tomkins ``Theory of affects'' \cite{primer_affect_psychology} as psychological model of emotions. We combine these theories in the cognitive architecture of Marvin Minsky ``The emotion machine'' \cite{emotionmachine}.\\
