#Pandora product description.


##Introduction

Introduce the TU product and the approach to demonstrating it’s characteristics through prototyping (essentially an abstract).  Should be approximately no more than half of page in length.  Should summarize the current IS system support problem with some reference/date support.  Should outline problem and needed solution characteristics.

Pandora product is problem processing system. 
It represents virtual personality with only one goal to help user. Virtual personality are trained to resolve only ITSM problems now, starting from monitoring of WINS, Posix, Storage systems till simple investigation/analysis of infrastructure incidents. Virtual personality is new type of service that reacts as human specialist in social environment and has cognition mechanism similar to human, therefore has emotions and exploits human thinking model. Virtual personality could be trained to solve problems in different domains except for ITSM, for example: accounting, health care, enterprise resource processing.

According to our estimates approximatelly 60 persent of problems processed daily by IS support specialists are primitive and could be processed by systems with machine understanding. To build machined understanding we exploit human thinking model with base approach described in Marvin Minsky Book the [Emotion Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion_machine).


##TU Product Description

Top level description of TU product (define functional scope - release ability to perform required functionality) for the average (stupid) reader – summary of the solution – and its goals and objectives.
Including:
System context – picture TU and interfaces to end user, learner, domain expert, Core expert and etc.

###Key Product Features and Capabilities

What does it do, what is significant/unique/innovative about it and what it accomplishes, describing how this solves the problem.

###Major Components (Hardware/Software)

Overview of how it is structured to do whatever it does – based on, and breakdown of software algorithms and flow component’s processes.

###Target Market/Customer Base

Who/what is if for – i.e. individuals, industry, environment – and why. Live for A.K input

##TU Product Prototype Description

Top level description of the TU prototype as it relates to the end product TU 0.1 prom release – goal.  Are capabilities reduced or eliminated? Simulated – modeled? Readiness for final development.

###Prototype Functional Goals and Objectives

Specific functional objectives the prototype will demonstrate and why these are significant Environment- show customer how we can do it, easy to use, intuitive, etc.  Input, Output.  Table of comparison between Current systems and TU Prototype either in here or next section.

###Prototype Architecture (Hardware/Software)

How will the prototype be structured to demonstrate key features of the TU 0.1 product.  Prototype TU provided and described.
Including:

1. All System Interfaces
1. Logical view (UMLenough)
1. Architecturally significant design packages: major - boundary classes, realization (logic view), process /task view (for example show Process view for end user submission  incident and RealTime threads and mechanism for problem solving and realization on UML diagrams (patterns) with steps descriptions
1. Deployment view (UMLenough)
1. System description (Node 1-2-3…etc)
1. Implementation view (overview, component description, KB model and etc)
1. General design decisions (architectural goals and constrains) – example: The architectural goals are to make the TU system modifiable and provide high performance and blah blah…  The TU system should be encapsulated so it's easy to port the system to different platform blah…blah…
1. Architectural patterns
1. User interface design
1. Implementation languages and tools
1. Installation and executing

###Prototype Features and Capabilities

What does the prototype demonstrate – why is that significant in showing how the problem is solved – or how we can demonstrate success. How does the prototype address the TU prom release 0.1 project risk mitigation?

###Prototype Development Challenges solved

Challenges expected solved such completing the objectives of the prototype – ie knowledge missing, capability missing, supporting technology issues, etc.
