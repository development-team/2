# TU Knowledge Base Infrastructure Services (IS) domain Learning Design based on Knowledge-Modeling Object Types (KMOT)

## Abstract
This document states and explains that a TU KB Knowledge Base Learning Design is the result of a knowledge TU instruction process where IT general and specific (Infrastructure Services) knowledge and competencies (TSS*) are combined.
Learning design in conjunction with Infrastructure Service (IS) delivery models are constructed in an integrated TU learning framework.
We also use knowledge graphical text recognition and a knowledge editor tool based on [Sikuli](http://www.sikuli.org/). Sikuli has been adapted to support the construction of TU KB learning design compliant with the IS Design GUI based knowledge specifications.
We place IS knowledge Design within a taxonomy of knowledge models, namely the multi-source IT Infrastructure domain support collaborative systems. We move up one step in the abstraction scale, showing that the process of constructing TU KB learning design can itself be viewed as virtual TSS skill set.
Unit-of-design: virtual TSS (KB) can be seen as constructing learning design, according  required skill set to recognize and perform particular operation, with domain IS staff expert’s support.
This viewpoint enables us to discuss and compare various TU KB “design plays”.
Further, the issue of representing knowledge, cognitive skills and TSS competencies is addressed.
The association between these “initial KB domain content” models and learning design of service workflow components/activity can guide the construction of KB learning designs and help to classify and tune TU cognition mechanism.

## Introduction
Building high quality TU KB learning designs is a very important task but a demanding one. The point of view that a TU KB Learning Design is the result of a charging TSS knowledge engineering process is put forth, where knowledge and competencies (TSS skill sets), learning design and service delivery (monitoring, operational, engineering) models/frameworks are constructed in an integrated knowledge framework.

In the next section of this article, a graphical knowledge recognition tool Sikuli with TU knowledge modeling language is defined. KMOT (knowledge modeling using object types) which was developed as the backbone of our instructional design method. Taxonomy of models will be presented and learning designs will be characterized in this taxonomy as multi-source adopted single knowledge process models.

The following section will present the KMOT + TU system knowledge domain recognition for IS KB Learning Designs. As well as some examples and a process to engineer learning designs from graphical sources (screen snapshots, GUI and etc). The last section presents other types of KMOT models which for Infrastructure domain knowledge and TSS staff competencies that can be used to evaluate the quality of TU KB learning designs. Finally, we propose that the domain (Infrastructure Services) and competency models can provide a knowledge classification scheme for a library of TSS roles and competencies learning design requirements according to sufficiency of knowledge to perform end operation activity.

## KMOT
KMOT is the method of specialization for knowledge and competency models using on the probabilistic logic weights. We place method within our taxonomy of knowledge models respectively as a multi knowledge collaborative process. The association between these “content” models and learning design components by TU KB is seen as the essential task in an TU system knowledge design methodology.

### Desirable properties in KMOT
That method help grasp by TU system the structure of related ideas by minimizing (clarification) the use of ambiguous natural language texts that allow increase confidence to  data object.

#### TU comprehension - friendliness. 
Not all graphic modeling languages are  system-friendly that using by human engineers, but contain itself valuable knowledge information. A good counter-example is UML. The large number of models and symbols require considerable expertise and a steep learning time for the interpretation by domain expert and for the construction of knowledge models for TU system KB. Furthermore, each type of model captures a different viewpoint of the information with own attitude to problem solving and it is provide a critical global view of a specific subject domain. The results TU system itself is preferred by the majority of tolerable solution taking into account intermediate sufficiently different meanings.

#### Generality. 
Generality means that the knowledge acquisition and self learning, as well as all knowledge in probabilistic reasoning subject domains, at various levels of granularity and precision should have the capacity to represented. It should enable, to represent by TU system simple models such as an instruction based solution (guide/workbook), up to complex models such as multi - leer knowledge with different level of trust to source of information, complex workflows, rule-based knowledge systems, methods and theories. 

## Knowledge Modeling
When IS KB domain expert start building a Knowledge Learning Design, two basic questions arise: "Which knowledge must be acquired by the system and what are the target competencies or educational objectives for that knowledge?" and "How should the activities and the environment be organized to achieve knowledge and competency acquisition by system?" In this section, we briefly present the basis for a TU system modeling and knowledge language adoption to provide system operational support to experts.

### Goals of the Sikuli KMOT graphic language recognition

Conceptual maps are widely used and presented in IT human education to represent and clarify complex relationships between concepts to facilitate knowledge construction and can be used by Sikuli + TU system as a KB learner. Flowcharts are graphical representations of service work instruction, procedural knowledge or workflow base resultant actions, which present graphical information, beside textural.
KMOT Knowledge Modelling, facilitates in system domain KB thought organization and communication knowledge that use between humans about the particular knowledge as the graphic representation, model, evolves. As will be seen, it can also be used both at a specialized domain knowledge level and at a meta-knowledge level, such as TSS virtual cognitive skills and competencies. Finally, the graphical KMOT as an executable program exports TU system resolution knowledge models for action processing.

### A New system KB instruction of Problem Solving Approach in 6 Phases.
New system KB knowledge adapted - resolution mechanism is subdivided into a number of steps where parts of a learning environment or system need to be constructed. These phases are sequential, but spiral, with frequent returns to modify knowledge section by the result of successful done tests (tasks on incident resolution) :
