# TU Knowledge Base Infrastructure Services (IS) domain Learning Design based on Knowledge-Modeling Object Types (KMOT)

## Abstract
This document states and explains that a TU KB Knowledge Base Learning Design is the result of a knowledge TU instruction process where IT general and specific (Infrastructure Services) knowledge and competencies (TSS*) are combined.
Learning design in conjunction with Infrastructure Service (IS) delivery models are constructed in an integrated TU learning framework.
We also use knowledge graphical text recognition and a knowledge editor tool based on [Sikuli](http://www.sikuli.org/). Sikuli has been adapted to support the construction of TU KB learning design compliant with the IS Design GUI based knowledge specifications.
We place IS knowledge Design within a taxonomy of knowledge models, namely the multi-source IT Infrastructure domain support collaborative systems. We move up one step in the abstraction scale, showing that the process of constructing TU KB learning design can itself be viewed as virtual TSS skill set.
Unit-of-design: virtual TSS (KB) can be seen as constructing learning design, according  required skill set to recognize and perform particular operation, with domain IS staff expert’s support.
This viewpoint enables us to discuss and compare various TU KB “design plays”.
Further, the issue of representing knowledge, cognitive skills and TSS competencies is addressed.
The association between these “initial KB domain content” models and learning design of service workflow components/activity can guide the construction of KB learning designs and help to classify and tune TU cognition mechanism.

## Introduction
Building high quality TU KB learning designs is a very important task but a demanding one. The point of view that a TU KB Learning Design is the result of a charging TSS knowledge engineering process is put forth, where knowledge and competencies (TSS skill sets), learning design and service delivery (monitoring, operational, engineering) models/frameworks are constructed in an integrated knowledge framework.

In the next section of this article, a graphical knowledge recognition tool Sikuli with TU knowledge modeling language is defined. KMOT (knowledge modeling using object types) which was developed as the backbone of our instructional design method. Taxonomy of models will be presented and learning designs will be characterized in this taxonomy as multi-source adopted single knowledge process models.

The following section will present the KMOT + TU system knowledge domain recognition for IS KB Learning Designs. As well as some examples and a process to engineer learning designs from graphical sources (screen snapshots, GUI and etc). The last section presents other types of KMOT models which for Infrastructure domain knowledge and TSS staff competencies that can be used to evaluate the quality of TU KB learning designs. Finally, we propose that the domain (Infrastructure Services) and competency models can provide a knowledge classification scheme for a library of TSS roles and competencies learning design requirements according to sufficiency of knowledge to perform end operation activity.

## KMOT
KMOT is the method of specialization for knowledge and competency models using on the probabilistic logic weights. We place method within our taxonomy of knowledge models respectively as a multi knowledge collaborative process. The association between these “content” models and learning design components by TU KB is seen as the essential task in an TU system knowledge design methodology.

### Desirable properties in KMOT
That method help grasp by TU system the structure of related ideas by minimizing (clarification) the use of ambiguous natural language texts that allow increase confidence to  data object.

#### TU comprehension - friendliness. 
Not all graphic modeling languages are  system-friendly that using by human engineers, but contain itself valuable knowledge information. A good counter-example is UML. The large number of models and symbols require considerable expertise and a steep learning time for the interpretation by domain expert and for the construction of knowledge models for TU system KB. Furthermore, each type of model captures a different viewpoint of the information with own attitude to problem solving and it is provide a critical global view of a specific subject domain. The results TU system itself is preferred by the majority of tolerable solution taking into account intermediate sufficiently different meanings.

#### Generality. 
Generality means that the knowledge acquisition and self learning, as well as all knowledge in probabilistic reasoning subject domains, at various levels of granularity and precision should have the capacity to represented. It should enable, to represent by TU system simple models such as an instruction based solution (guide/workbook), up to complex models such as multi - leer knowledge with different level of trust to source of information, complex workflows, rule-based knowledge systems, methods and theories. 

## Knowledge Modeling
When IS KB domain expert start building a Knowledge Learning Design, two basic questions arise: "Which knowledge must be acquired by the system and what are the target competencies or educational objectives for that knowledge?" and "How should the activities and the environment be organized to achieve knowledge and competency acquisition by system?" In this section, we briefly present the basis for a TU system modeling and knowledge language adoption to provide system operational support to experts.

### Goals of the Sikuli KMOT graphic language recognition

Conceptual maps are widely used and presented in IT human education to represent and clarify complex relationships between concepts to facilitate knowledge construction and can be used by Sikuli + TU system as a KB learner. Flowcharts are graphical representations of service work instruction, procedural knowledge or workflow base resultant actions, which present graphical information, beside textural.
KMOT Knowledge Modelling, facilitates in system domain KB thought organization and communication knowledge that use between humans about the particular knowledge as the graphic representation, model, evolves. As will be seen, it can also be used both at a specialized domain knowledge level and at a meta-knowledge level, such as TSS virtual cognitive skills and competencies. Finally, the graphical KMOT as an executable program exports TU system resolution knowledge models for action processing.

### A TU system training approach for Problem Solving.
TU system KB knowledge adapted - resolution mechanism is subdivided into a number of steps where parts of a learning environment or system need to be constructed. These phases are sequential, but spiral, with frequent returns to modify knowledge section by the result of successful done tests (tasks on incident resolution) :

#### Phase 1: 
Expert build a description of the skill set requirements and problem, TU system should solve it's context and constraints. The general goal that the TU system KB must fulfill and the main characteristics of the target service knowledge coverage are the most important aspects to address at this point. 

#### Phase 2: 
Expert defines a preliminary training solution, centered on a knowledge model for the learning domain. Prerequisite and target competencies are associated to the most important knowledge entities in the model. In this phase, expert also build a first TU system  KB pedagogical model, including all knowledge  objectives called “the TU System learning event network” grouping the main knowledge modules or learning units, their sequencing and the additional knowledge needed to perform them or to be produced by system KB  learner.

#### Phase 3: 
Expert constructs and puts in TU system KB for processing a complete detailed learning design material. At the same time, a sub-model of the phase 2 knowledge model is associated to each learning unit thus defining “the learning unit content in processing”. According to the evolution of the design, media and delivery principles are refined to prepare the next phase.

#### Phase 4: 
Centered on the learning input in KB resources and service delivery, competency models and the properties of objects in these models several professionals may work together. TU system KB support specialists, domain experts establishes system KB knowledge understanding criteria’s and making knowledge acceptance tests. 

#### Phase 5: 
Upon passing all tests the expert plans the validation of the TU system KB learning environment and produces a list of possible revisions and decisions for improvement of the specifications used in the previous phases.

#### Phase 6: 
Expert and service manager prepare KB elements necessary for the delivery of the learning environment to production. 


### A knowledge modeling approach.

In each of phases 2, 3 and 4, expert also proposes the development of the KB learning environment along four axes: virtual TSS knowledge and competency (content model), instructional (workflow), domain knowledgeable resources and resolution mechanism cognition. The Sikuli is used as a graphic text recognition mechanism of each axis.
The Expert’s domain Knowledge Model centers on a representation of the learning environment content domain. In this model, the domain’s facts, standard descriptions, concepts, procedures and principles are indicated and interrelated with probabilistic links to produce explicit TU system IS KB knowledge structure. Then target and prerequisite TSS competencies are linked to knowledge element in the model. 
*The Instructional Model* is essentially a service workflow based network of learning events and resources according level of operations (monitoring, operational, engineering), to which knowledge and target competencies are associated. Each learning resource is also described by a learning scenario specifying learning and support activities linked to project specific environment.

## Generic virtual TSS Skills (Competencies) and Learning Designs.

The relationship between a learning TU system KB domain design model and a “narrow” TSS knowledge and competency model is critical. As a prerequisites and learning objectives can be defined using the IS-Service specification. Using unstructured text to define competencies or learning objectives is not sufficient to help guide the TU system KB learning design environment. Furthermore, TSS competencies should be linked to particular knowledge resurces in the learning domain, where both should be associated to operational model, and activities according TSS roles and technical competencies.  In this section, the notion of TSS competency specification is elaborated by relating cognitive skills to knowledge, our New system KB taxonomy of cognitive skills is defined, a way to represent them as procedural knowledge models is understand by system. 

### Competency: Cognitive Skills Applied to Knowledge

To say that a TU system knows something (put initial domain prerequisite) or that a system must acquire additionally such or such knowledge (learning objective) is not sufficient. What is needed is to specify a degree or a level of knowledge mastery. Thus, we define a competency as a statement that a "New smart virtual TSS" has the ability to apply to a certain knowledge resource, a precise cognitive skill, with a specific degree of “performance” in a certain context.

Possessing a cognitive skill means that a TU system KB as a learner can solve a corresponding class of problems. For example, if a TU system KB possesses a diagnostic or classification skill, it should be able to solve some diagnostic or classification problems to a certain performance level prescribed by the context. Another view is to see cognitive skills as active procedural – service workflow based knowledge (generic procedures) applied to general TU system KB IS domain knowledge. A third view considers the association between cognitive skills and application environment knowledge (WINTEL platform for example) as objects to be learned together. Integrating all three viewpoints will enable IS domain expert and TU system core expert to provide a complete New system KB domain cognitive skills taxonomy.

### A New system based virtual TSS Skill Taxonomy

In this taxonomy, cognitive skills can be viewed according to three perspectives: as a generic system problem solving process, as procedural or workflow – instruction (workbook) based knowledge acting on knowledge or as a learning objective related to a particular knowledge processing task (ticket 2/3 line - incident resolution). 

## Conclusion

The systematic interpretation of competencies (technology, practical tips from previous realisation) using the cognitive skills taxonomy creates a bridge between TSS competency profiles and TU system self instructional engineering in many ways. For each main knowledge resource (problem object description, software, network configuration, hardware troubleshooting and etc)  , the gap between the entry or actual competency and the target competency of the system’s KB as a learner can guide the construction of knowledge models; if the gap is large, for example starting filling system KB at a simple TSS1-2 memorizing skill based mainly on work instructions targeting an system IS service domain evaluation skill , then the knowledge model will be quite complex, more so then if the goal is just to increase the problem solving performance level within an evaluation skill in IS broaden domain’s services. That allow bring New system own knowledge an experience in realisation more complex task on higher level. 
As described, New system IS virtual TTS target competencies and their associated cognitive skill process model provide a solid foundation to system KB effective and efficient learning scenarios ensuring some type of mechanism finding and solving control as well as serving as criteria for classifying all system’s incoming learning design templates, workbooks, instructions, graphics information (screenshots) and etc. Virtual TSS competency models also makes it possible to create  activities for other New system specific KB in the learning design aiming to improve coordination between new roles with different skills requirements and to offer by New system KB appropriately adapted new virtual skill set in each case .
In this document, we have advanced a new system knowledge acquisition – realisation strategy, competency design based on a specific IS Remote Service knowledge model, describing from an variety  sources (structural - not structural technical information, domain learning specification objectives, graphical information and any)   design process that facilitates New system KB’s particular knowledge tasks to create learning designs objectives its understanding and acceptance which are New system spiral multi-leer learning processes. An system instructional engineering method is itself a multi- knowledge – human TSS actor integration process (New system functional and thinking understanding behavior is a TSS model) used to engineer other multi – KB specific knowledge systems – TSS actor integration for single business environment New system and TSS human staff. 
Learning knowledge design based on graphical knowledge modeling (New system+Sikuli) is the basis of all the discussion carried out here. It helps situate the components and the levels of knowledge involved in a more precise textural –linguistic and transparent way to acquire knowledge by system. Our goal is now aimed at providing user-friendly and powerful tools as a  vendor offering Remote Infrastructure Services to increase the service production and eliminate Technical Support Specialist’s manual labour.
