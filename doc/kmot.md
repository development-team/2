# TU Knowledge Base Infrastructure Services (IS) domain Learning Design based on Knowledge-Modeling Object Types (KMOT)

## Abstract
This document states and explains that a TU KB Knowledge Base Learning Design is the result of a knowledge TU instruction process where IT general and specific (Infrastructure Services) knowledge and competencies (TSS*) are combined.
Learning design in conjunction with Infrastructure Service (IS) delivery models are constructed in an integrated TU learning framework.
We also use knowledge graphical text recognition and a knowledge editor tool based on [Sikuli](http://www.sikuli.org/). Sikuli has been adapted to support the construction of TU KB learning design compliant with the IS Design GUI based knowledge specifications.
We place IS knowledge Design within a taxonomy of knowledge models, namely the multi-source IT Infrastructure domain support collaborative systems. We move up one step in the abstraction scale, showing that the process of constructing TU KB learning design can itself be viewed as virtual TSS skill set.
Unit-of-design: virtual TSS (KB) can be seen as constructing learning design, according  required skill set to recognize and perform particular operation, with domain IS staff expert’s support.
This viewpoint enables us to discuss and compare various TU KB “design plays”.
Further, the issue of representing knowledge, cognitive skills and TSS competencies is addressed.
The association between these “initial KB domain content” models and learning design of service workflow components/activity can guide the construction of KB learning designs and help to classify and tune TU cognition mechanism.

## Introduction
Building high quality TU KB learning designs is a very important task but a demanding one. The point of view that a TU KB Learning Design is the result of a charging TSS knowledge engineering process is put forth, where knowledge and competencies (TSS skill sets), learning design and service delivery (monitoring, operational, engineering) models/frameworks are constructed in an integrated knowledge framework.

In the next section of this article, a graphical knowledge recognition tool Sikuli with TU knowledge modeling language is defined. KMOT (knowledge modeling using object types) which was developed as the backbone of our instructional design method. Taxonomy of models will be presented and learning designs will be characterized in this taxonomy as multi-source adopted single knowledge process models.
