#Pandora product and prototype description.


##Introduction

Pandora product is problem processing system. It represents new approach to service oriented business model. It also provides remote infrastructure managment like RIM, IaaS model, e.t.c. However, in different way: Pandora inroduces Technology as a Services. 

##Product Description

Pandora - system that leverage Machine Understanding theory into the main application of such a theory in order to develop solutions with IT infrastructure capabilities. Main goal is to create machine understanding mechanism for explaining what is to comprehend, to understand and to mean, in a IT domain with delivered solution for  a wide variety of core Infrastructure utility Services, such as hosted cloud, storage, server, collaboration and more, governed by an advanced Pandora  IT Knowledge Base. 

Pandora is not software product in common sense as it suppose to be. Pandora is a technology that provided as a Service to your customers. For example, if you support remote infrastructure of your customer we will provide Pandora system to you, which was trained by your support personal and will act as technology support specialist. 

Pandora support nexts functions:

 1. Dialog support
   2. Clarification requests.
   2. Confirmation requests.
   2. Escalations of to hard to solve problems.
 1. Training:
   2. Training domain(s) concepts.
   2. Training problem solving how-to-s.
 1. Operation:
   2. Find solution.
   2. Apply found solution.

Pandora can be trained with knowledges by human specialists, can interacts with human specialist while problem solving, if it can solve it by itself.

Pandora collaborates with several human specialists:

 1. Domain user - virtual personality user, that uses system in the boundaries of one domain.
 1. Domain trainer - domain expert capable of training the virtual personality domain concepts and their links.
 1. How-to trainer - human technical support specialist capable to train virtual personality methods and resources to solve domain user problems.

###Key Product Features and Capabilities

Pandora is capable of three main activities:
 1. Communicate and collaborate with human specialist in dialog mode.
 1. Be trained and train domain knowledge and problem solution how-to-s.
 1. Find most probable solution.
 1. Apply found solution over target system.

Pandora can be compatible with modern RIM systems like:
 1. HP Open View
 1. LANDesk Management Suite
 1. System Center Configuration Manager 
 1. others
 
###Major Components (Hardware/Software)

![Main component diagram](https://github.com/development-team/2/raw/master/doc/design-specification/uml/images/MainComponent.png)

 1. [Thinking life cycle](design-specification/thinking-life-cycle.md)
 1. [Selector](design-specification/selector.md)
 1. [Critics](design-specification/critics.md)
 1. [Way to think](design-specification/way2Think.md)

ThinkingLifeCycle starts and stops internal processes. Selector retrieves Resources(Critic, Way to think) using Critic request. Critic is main analytical module of short term memory. Way to think actually changes contents of short term memory.

###Target Market/Customer Base

 1. Remote Infrastructure Managment
 1. Remote Infrastructure Support
 1. Companies that do not want to support they infrastuctures by they employies

##Pandora Product Prototype Description

Top level description of the TU prototype as it relates to the end product TU 0.1 prom release – goal.  Are capabilities reduced or eliminated? Simulated – modeled? Readiness for final development.

###Prototype Functional Goals and Objectives

Specific functional objectives the prototype will demonstrate and why these are significant Environment- show customer how we can do it, easy to use, intuitive, etc.  Input, Output.  Table of comparison between Current systems and TU Prototype either in here or next section.

Pandora prototype will cover next functions:

 1. Incident processing in natural language
 1. Training mode
 1. Solution applicator
 1. Ability to integrate with existing incident systems
 1. Ability to integrate with existing solution application systems 

###Prototype Architecture (Hardware/Software)

How will the prototype be structured to demonstrate key features of the TU 0.1 product.  Prototype TU provided and described.
Including:

1. All System Interfaces
1. Logical view (UMLenough)
1. Architecturally significant design packages: major - boundary classes, realization (logic view), process /task view (for example show Process view for end user submission  incident and RealTime threads and mechanism for problem solving and realization on UML diagrams (patterns) with steps descriptions
1. Deployment view (UMLenough)
1. System description (Node 1-2-3…etc)
1. Implementation view (overview, component description, KB model and etc)
1. General design decisions (architectural goals and constrains) – example: The architectural goals are to make the TU system modifiable and provide high performance and blah blah…  The TU system should be encapsulated so it's easy to port the system to different platform blah…blah…
1. Architectural patterns
1. User interface design
1. Implementation languages and tools
1. Installation and executing

###Prototype Features and Capabilities

What does the prototype demonstrate – why is that significant in showing how the problem is solved – or how we can demonstrate success. How does the prototype address the TU prom release 0.1 project risk mitigation?

###Prototype Development Challenges solved

Challenges expected solved such completing the objectives of the prototype – ie knowledge missing, capability missing, supporting technology issues, etc.
