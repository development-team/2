# Emotional behavior

![Sentic axis](sentic axis Plutchik-wheel.png)

According to [Sentic computing](http://sentic.net/senticcomputing.pdf) PlutchikÂ´s wheel of emotions could be represented in 4 sentic axis:

 1. Sensitivity
 1. Attention
 1. Pleasantness
 1. Aptitude

On each axis lies 2 emotions with 3 sentic levels, see diagram above.

According to [3.2.2 The Hourglass of Emotions](http://sentic.net/senticcomputing.pdf) there are 6 emotional states on each axis:

 1. Sensitivity: rage, anger, annoyance, apprehension, fear, terror.
 1. Attention: vigilance, anticipation, interest, distraction, surprise, amazement.
 1. Pleasantness: ecstasy, joy, serenity, pensiveness, sadness, grief.
 1. Aptitude: admiration, trust, acceptance, boredom, disgust, loathing.

According to behavior influence over the system axis could be grouped as following:

 1. Resource distribution:
   2. Sensitivity
   2. Attention
 1. Emotional highlight:
  2. Pleasantness
  2. Aptitude

## Resource distribution

Is managed in 2 dimensions: Sensitivity manages speed of processes and Attention manges number of resources, for example thinking threads.
Rage makes system act as quick as possible taking in account as less variants as possible.
Terror makes system struck almost stopping all current computations.
Vigilance makes system concentrate all computational resources on current task. All available threads should be distributed to current process.
Amazement releases as much computational resources as possible leaving current process with minimum threads.
