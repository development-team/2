# Emotional behavior

[PlutchikÂ´s wheel of emotions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutchik%27s_Wheel_of_Emotions#Plutchik.27s_wheel_of_emotions) contains 8 basic emotions grouped in pairs:

 * Joy - Sadness
 * Trust - Disgust
 * Fear - Anger
 * Surprise - Anticipation

According to [Sentic computing: 3.2.2 The Hourglass of Emotions](http://sentic.net/senticcomputing.pdf) Plutchik's wheel could be represented in 4 sentic dimensions:

 1. **Sensitivity**: Fear - Anger: the user is comfortable with interaction dynamics 
 1. **Attention**: Surprise - Anticipation: the user is interested in interaction contents
 1. **Pleasantness**: Joy - Sadness: the user is amused by interaction modalities
 1. **Aptitude**: Trust - Disgust: the user is confident in interaction benefits

On each axis lies 2 basic emotions with 3 sentic levels, there are 6 emotional states on each axis:

 1. **Sensitivity**: rage, anger, annoyance, apprehension, fear, terror.
 1. **Attention**: vigilance, anticipation, interest, distraction, surprise, amazement.
 1. **Pleasantness**: ecstasy, joy, serenity, pensiveness, sadness, grief.
 1. **Aptitude**: admiration, trust, acceptance, boredom, disgust, loathing.

Also according to [Sentic computing: 3.2.2 The Hourglass of Emotions](http://sentic.net/senticcomputing.pdf) emotion strength is determined by Gaussian function
G(x) = -1*e^((-x^2)/(2*sigma^2)):

Emotions of one axis has same nature that determines the way they affect the system.
According to the way emotions affect the system behaviour sentic axises are grouped in a following way:

 1. Resource distribution is affected by:
   2. Sensitivity
   2. Attention
 1. Emotional highlight is affected by:
  2. Pleasantness
  2. Aptitude 

## Resource distribution

Resource distribution is influenced in 2 dimensions: Sensitivity manages speed of processes and Attention manges number of resources, for example thinking threads.
 * Sensitivity:Rage makes system act as quick as possible taking in account as less variants as possible.
 * Sensitivity:Terror makes system struck almost stopping all current computations.
 * Attention:Vigilance makes system concentrate all computational resources on current task. All available threads should be distributed to current process.
 * Attention:Amazement releases as much computational resources as possible leaving current process with minimum threads.

##Emotional highlight

Emotional highlight is two dimensional: Pleasantness to Aptitude.
Each training act, such as: domain concept explanation, feedback and so on is highlighted in two dimensions according to current positive impression (pleasantness) and future benefit expectations(aptitude).
