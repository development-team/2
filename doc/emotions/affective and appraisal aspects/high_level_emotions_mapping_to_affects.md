# High level emotions mapping to affects.

According to Plutchik "Wheel of emotions"[[wheel_of_emotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutchik%27s_Wheel_of_Emotions#Plutchik.27s_wheel_of_emotions)] high level emotions are produced as mixture of 2 or basic emotions(affects):


[Tomkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvan_Tomkins) used to address basic emotions as affects and Lovheim recently presented neuromediators based work called "Cube of emotions". Lovheim demonstrated relations of neuromediators concentrations and emotional/affective states.

We interpret affects as instinctive reactions that stands close to objective brain response to any stimulus.

## High level emotion influence over affects

High level emotions are mixtures of basic emotions/affects, they are interpreted as intermediate states in "Cube of emotions".

1. Optimism =	Anticipation + Joy
1. Love =	Joy + Trust
1. Submission = Trust + Fear
1. Awe = Fear + Surprise
1. Disapproval = Surprise + Sadness
1. Remorse = Sadness + Disgust
1. Contempt = Disgust + Anger
1. Aggressiveness =	Anger + Anticipation

Translation into neuromediators concentrations:

1. **Optimism** = 1.0 serotonin + 1.0 dopamine + 0.5 noradrenaline;
1. **Love** = 0.75 serotonin + 1.0 dopamine + 0.0 noradrenaline;
1. **Submission** = 0.25 serotonin + 1.0 dopamine + 0.0 noradrenaline;
1. **Awe** = 0.5 serotonin + 0.5 dopamine + 0.5 noradrenaline;
1. **Disapproval** = 0.5 serotonin + 0.0 dopamine + 1.0 noradrenaline;
1. **Remorse** = 0.0 serotonin + 0.0 dopamine + 0.0 noradrenaline;
1. **Contempt** = 0.5 serotonin + 0.5 dopamine + 0.5 noradrenaline;
1. **Aggressiveness** =	0.5 serotonin + 1.0 dopamine + 1.0 noradrenaline;
