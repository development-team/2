#Appraisal aspect

Firs aspect that was not describe in previous article is: how actually inbound stimulus is appraised? There are several appraisal theories that were used to find proper answer to this question. We explored Scherer, Smith and Kirby, Roseman and Tomkins  approaches of synthesise appraisal framework.
Overall appraisal process could be depicted like presented below

Firstly: stimulus is appraised non-consciously this could be interpreted like signal processing in spinal cord, hypothalamus, amygdala, we correspond these subsystems with instinctive layer of Minsky's thinking model (model of six), see [emotionmachine]. This first affective appraisal starts neuromodulation [cubeofemotions] and cognitive appraisal that takes place in frontal cortex and cingulate cortex which in their turn corresponds to: learned reactions, deliberative, reflective thinking, self-reflective thinking, self-conscious reflections layers of Minsky's model of six. Cognitive appraisal usually is associated with much longer process than instinctive affective appraisals that could influence non-conscious processes and emotional state.

##Non-conscious appraisal

We use Tomkins theory of affects that refer to innate emotions as appraisal base for non-conscious emotional reactions.
Tomkins theory [tomkins1, tomkins2, tomkins3, tomkins4] include following affects, that we roughly correspond with Plutchik basic emotions[natureofemotions].

Tomkins affects:

1. Enjoyment/Joy
1. Interest/Excitement
1. Surprise
1. Anger/Rage
1. Disgust
1. Distress/Anguish
1. Fear/Terror
1. Shame/Humiliation
