#Appraisal aspect

First aspect that was not describe in previous article is: how actually inbound stimulus is appraised to trigger proper emotion? There are several appraisal theories that we used to find proper answer to this question. We explored Scherer, Smith and Kirby, Roseman and Tomkins  approaches of synthesise appraisal framework.
Overall appraisal process could be depicted like presented below

Firstly stimulus is appraised non-consciously via affective appraisal it could be interpreted like signal processing in spinal cord, hypothalamus and amygdala secondly stimulus is processed via cognitive appraisal that takes place in frontal cortex and cingulate cortex. We correspond affective appraisal  with instinctive layer of Minsky's thinking model (model of six) [emotionmachine]. This non-conscious appraisal triggers neuromodulation [cubeofemotions] and then cognitive appraisal which in its turn corresponds to: learned reactions, deliberative, reflective thinking, self-reflective thinking, self-conscious reflections layers of Minsky's model of six. Cognitive appraisal usually is associated with much longer process than instinctive affective appraisals that could influence non-conscious processes(behaviour) and emotional state. After this cognitive reappraisal could change the emotional state taking in account some deliberative thinking of the stimulus and the personality relation with it.

##Non-conscious appraisal

We use Tomkins theory of affects that refer to innate emotional reactions as appraisal base for non-conscious emotional reactions. Tomkins theory [tomkins1, tomkins2, tomkins3, tomkins4] includes following affects:

Tomkins affects:

1. Enjoyment/Joy
1. Interest/Excitement
1. Surprise
1. Anger/Rage
1. Disgust
1. Distress/Anguish
1. Fear/Terror
1. Shame/Humiliation

We use Tomkins affective appraisal described in "A primer of affect psychology" [primer_affect_psychology]. The main factor that influences affective appraisal is brain activity that has three main behaviour trends: increase, decrease or stay stable.

According to Kelly: quickest increase of brain activity triggers **surprise**, a bit slower increase - **fear/terror**, and most moderate - **interest/excitement**.

Moderate steady CNS activity triggers **distress/anguish**, while high steady activity triggers **anger/rage**, both of them negative.
It worth to note that the higher distress CNS activity the easier is switch to anger. We could interpret this like: the longer person is in distress state the easier he/she could be switched to anger state.

Decrease of CNS activity is interpreted as relief and triggers **enjoyment/joy**.

"**Disgust** NEGATIVE affect is inherently punishing and provides us some protection against eating
poisonous or rotten food."

**Shame humiliation** "affect is neither inherently punishing nor
rewarding. It is like a computer’s reset button that rapidly clears the system and prepares us for whatever
comes next.

Here is an example of the difference in these two situations: imagine you are waiting in your friend’s
car while she is in the supermarket. Your interest is triggered by something you see and your attention
(conscious awareness) is directed to the children in the playground across the street. You see that they are
playing a game you have never seen before. The novelty of the game triggers more interest. After several
minutes, you figure out the game they are playing. The children keep playing but repeat the same actions
over and over again. The game, therefore, loses its novelty and your interest diminishes and soon there is
a natural termination of the stimulus conditions for interest-excitement and that affect simply stops.
Because the stimulus has ceased, you are no longer motivated to direct your attention to the game.

Without the innate affect shame-humiliation, we would not be motivated to take action when we are
deprived of interesting and enjoyable things."

##Conscious appraisal

Tomkins theory is based on innate affects that we roughly correspond with Plutchik basic emotions[natureofemotions]. Our main assumption was that conscious and non-conscious appraisal could use different rules. Innate and quick affective appraisal is processed in automatic way mostly insensibly for human, it does not include long term deliberations, learned reactions or reflections. In contrast to affective appraisal, conscious cognitive appraisal done in frontal cortex and cingulate cortex and includes learned reactions, deliberations and reflective thinking. It could take some significant time that could exceed affective appraisal a few tens of times. This factors, especially involvement of learned reactions mechanisms defines nature of conscious appraisal. We suppose that main mechanism defining the conscious appraisal is education of personality to react in some specific way on some specific stimulus. We use Scherer's approach described in 
"Appraisal considered as process of multilevel sequential checking"[appraisal_as_sequential_checking]. We use Plutchik [natureofemotion] as model for conscious emotions. This model consists of 8 basic emotions grouped in pairs.

1. Joy - sorrow
1. Anger - fear
1. Acceptance - disgust
1. Surprise - expectancy

Scherer uses 14 emotions and 16
