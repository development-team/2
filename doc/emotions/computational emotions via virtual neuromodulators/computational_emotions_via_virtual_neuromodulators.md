## Introduction

Biggest problem of artificial intelligence is that we don't know what is natural intelligence. The only example of intelligence that we observe today is human intelligence. Unfortunately there are not aliens that would be able to demonstrate the other way (non-human) intelligence could evolve through the years.
There are several domains that still remains unclear: creativity, intuition, insight that prevents us from answer how David Lynch could create  Mulholland Drive or Picasso could create Guernica.

Turing stated in his [intelligent_machinery] that idea of intelligent machines "cannot be wholly ignored, because the idea of 'intelligence' is itself emotional rather than mathematical".

This article is dedicated to emotional aspects of human thinking and influence of emotions on computational processes in Marvin Minsky cognitive architecture [emotionmachine]. It could be considered as base of computational emotional thinking framework. This kind of framework could be used in several domains like:

1. Emotional behavior simulations
1. Robotics
1. Intellectual assistants
1. Estimating human behaviour
1. Nursing software and robotics.


## Bases

We used 4 bases for our synthetic theory of artificial emotions:

![3 bases of theory](3_bases.png)

First base is evolutionary psychology theory of Plutchik [natureofemotions]. We used main emotional process (feedback loops) from it and adopted it to Model of six [emotionmachine] (6 thinking levels of Marvin Minsky cognitive architecture. We used "Wheel of emotions" [natureofemotions] as model for subjective conscious emotions and high level emotions.
Second base is theory of affects by Tomkins [primer_affect_psychology, tomkins1, tomkins2, tomkins3], we used it as the base for low level non-conscious emotions and low level appraisal.
Neuro-physiological base is Lovheim theory of neuromodulatory base of emotions [cubeofemotions]. We used "Cube of emotions" as main low level ("hardware") mechanism of emotional processes.

 1. Generic:
   2. CPU power: noradrenaline
   2. Memory distribution (attention): noradrenaline
   2. Learning: serotonin, dopamine
   2. Storage: serotonin, dopamine
 1. Decision making/reward processing:
   2. Confidence: serotonin
   2. Satisfaction: serotonin
   2. Motivation, wanting: dopamine
   2. Risky choices inclination: noradrenaline
   2. Number of options to process: noradrenaline

## Appraisal and coping

## High level and low level emotions

1. **G(Optimism Intensity)** = 1.0 serotonin  + 1.0 dopamine + 0.5 noradrenaline;
1. **G(Love Intensity)** = 0.75 serotonin + 1.0 dopamine + 0.0 noradrenaline;
1. **G(Submission Intensity)** = 0.25 serotonin + 1.0 dopamine + 0.0 noradrenaline;
1. **G(Awe Intensity)** = 0.5 serotonin + 0.5 dopamine + 0.5 noradrenaline;
1. **G(Disapproval Intensity)** = 0.5 serotonin + 0.0 dopamine + 1.0 noradrenaline;
1. **G(Remorse Intensity)** = 0.0 serotonin + 0.0 dopamine + 0.0 noradrenaline;
1. **G(Contempt Intensity)** = 0.5 serotonin + 0.5 dopamine + 0.5 noradrenaline;
1. **G(Aggressiveness Intensity)** = 0.5 serotonin + 1.0 dopamine + 1.0 noradrenaline;
