##Artificial emotions via virtual neuromodulators

## Introduction

Biggest problem of artificial intelligence is that we don't know what is natural intelligence. The only example of intelligence that we observe today is human intelligence. Unfortunately there are not aliens that would be able to demonstrate the other way (non-human) intelligence could evolve through the years. Rosalind Picard in her article indicated: "There  may  exist  a  kind  of  alien  intelligent  living  system,  something we’ve  never  encountered,  which  achieves  its  intelligence  without  having  anything  like emotion.      Although  humans  are  the  most  marvellous  example  of  intelligence  we  have, and  we  wish  to  build  systems  that  are  natural  for  humans  to  understand,  these  reasons
for building human-like systems should not limit us to thinking only of human abilities." [affectivecomputingchallanges]

There are several domains that still remains unclear: creativity, intuition, insight and consciousness that prevents us from answering the question: "How David Lynch could create Mulholland Drive or Picasso could create Guernica?".
We have started from possibly first emerged during evolution and most low level component of intelligence: the emotions.

Turing stated in his [intelligent_machinery] that idea of intelligent machines "cannot be wholly ignored, because the idea of 'intelligence' is itself emotional rather than mathematical".
Marvin Minsky in his book "The emotion machine" proposed that emotions are inseparable from thinking "Emotional thinking: A flash of impatience or anger can cut through what seems like a hopelessly tangled knot. Each such ‘emotional way to think' is a different way to deal with things, and some can increase your persistence or courage, while others can help you simplify things. In any case, after each such change, you may still want to pursue some similar goals, but now you'll see them from new points of view — because each switch to a new Way to Think may initiate a large-scale cascade. Then, depending on how long those changes persist, you (or your friends) might recognize this as a change in your emotional state".

This article is dedicated to emotional aspects of human thinking and influence of emotions on computational processes in Marvin Minsky cognitive architecture [emotionmachine]. It could be considered as base of computational emotional thinking framework. This kind of framework could be used in several domains like:

1. Emotional behavior simulations

1. Intellectual assistants
1. Estimating human behaviour
1. Nursing software and robotics.

## Bases

Starting from the top we first reviewed several psychological models of emotions. Then we tried to understand the low level nature of emotions that brought us to neuro-scientific base of emotions. As we got the picture of human emotional processes we mapped them to cognitive architecture to gain AI basis. This model was depicted in the picture below: 

![3 bases of theory](3_bases.png)

First base is evolutionary psychology theory of Plutchik [natureofemotions]. We used main emotional process (feedback loops) from it and adopted it to Model of six [emotionmachine] 6 thinking levels of Marvin Minsky cognitive architecture. We used "Wheel of emotions" [natureofemotions] as model for subjective conscious emotions and high level emotions.
Second base is theory of affects by Tomkins [primer_affect_psychology, tomkins1, tomkins2, tomkins3], we used it as the base for low level non-conscious emotions and low level appraisal.
Neuro-physiological base is Lovheim theory of neuromodulatory base of emotions [cubeofemotions]. We used "Cube of emotions" as main low level ("hardware") mechanism of emotional processes.
All theories described above were mapped to Marvin Minsky's cognitive architecture described in his book "The emotion machine" [emotionmachine].

##Emotional feedback loops

Robert Plutchik created the three dimensional model of emotions [natureofemotions] called "Wheel of emotions", that we used as subjective conscious model of emotions. He used 8 basic emotions grouped in pairs:

1. Joy - sorrow
1. Anger - fear
1. Acceptance - disgust
1. Surprise - expectancy

We suppose that innate non-conscious affects and their appraisals could use different much more quick and simple mechanisms than developed, trained during life time conscious emotions, appraisals and coping. This way we use two models: affect theory for innate quick emotional reactions and "wheel of emotions" for conscious low level and high level emotions. According to Plutchik theory basic emotions could be mixed like colors into high level emotions listed below:

1. Love = joy + acceptance
1. Submission = acceptance + fear
1. Awe = fear + surprise
1. Disapproval = surprise + sorrow
1. Remorse = sorrow + disgust
1. Contempt = disgust + anger
1. Aggressiveness = anger + expectancy
1. Optimism = expectancy + joy

This could be understood as base for subjective picture of emotions.

Below is an example of emotional feedback loops [natureofemotions] represented in 4 layers of Marvin Minsky "model of six".

![orchestra of emotions](orchestra_of_emotions_agi.png)

We used 4 of six layers just for purpose of this example. Self-conscious reflections layer could influence emotions, for example evaluation of self as not progressing could cause sorrow or even depression, but it was not shown on the diagram.

We correspond instinctive reactions layer with non-conscious, innate, affective reactions that mainly takes palace in: spinal cord, hypothalamus and amygdala. This way any stimulus is been processed firstly non-consciously, this is shown as affective appraisal rectangle. First stimulus triggers affective appraisal and affective appraisal triggers neuromodulation. Actually neuromodulation is not the result of appraisal, but non-conscious appraisal is accompanied by neuromodulation on the way from spinal cord to hypothalamus and amygdala. Neuromodulation triggers emotional state switch from serenity to fear. Affective appraisal triggers cognitive appraisal and reflective thinking. Cognitive appraisal in its turn initiates deliberation process. Meanwhile second stimulus triggers second affective appraisal and its neuromodulation switches emotional state from fear to terror. Second affective appraisal triggers cognitive appraisal that in its turn initiates second appraisal deliberation. Then reflective thinking process estimating all activities in mind realized that it's too emotional now and thus stopped all appraisal related processes and started new coping oriented deliberation and switched emotional state via neuromodulation from terror to fear. Third appraisal deliberation selects cognitive reappraisal as coping strategy and this coping strategy is executed and switches emotional state back to serenity (via neuromodulation). 
In parallel to all cognitive and reflective process second affective appraisal initiates non-conscious instinctive coping strategy, that when applied created an effect over environment and this effect is been appraised again as stimulus.

##Neuromodulatory basis of artificial emotions

Hugo Lovheim in 2012 published his article "A new three-dimensional model for emotions and monoamine neurotransmitters". He described thee dimensional model of emotions. Axis of the model are neuromodulators(monoamines): serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline. Vertexes are affects from Tomkins affect theory [primer_affect_psychology]:

1. Enjoyment/Joy
1. Interest/Excitement
1. Surprise
1. Anger/Rage
1. Disgust
1. Distress/Anguish
1. Fear/Terror
1. Shame/Humiliation

From our perspective this is the base of objective non-conscious emotional brain reaction to stimulus. On the other hand according to [emotionsbraintorobot] there are four following neuronal systems involved in to emotional processing:

1. Spinal cord
1. Hypothalamus
1. Amygdala
1. Frontal cortex, cingulate cortex

We roughly correspond non-conscious instinctive reactions layer of "model of six" [emotionmachine] with spinal cord, hypothalamus and amygdala, while conscious processes and learned reactions, deliberative thinking, reflective thinking, self-reflective thinking, self-conscious reflections with frontal and cingulate cortex. This approach could be understood as subjective emotions to objective brain reaction bridge. This is fundamental for representation of emotional processes on computational system parameters.

##Neuromodulators to computing parameters mapping 

Having neuromodulation mechanisms understanding, mainly the roles of neuromodulators [cubeofemotions, emotionsbraintorobot] we proposed following mapping of neuromodulators to computing system parameters.

![parameter mapping](cube_of_parameters_agi.png)

1. Generic:
  2. CPU power: noradrenaline
  2. Memory distribution (attention): noradrenaline
  2. Learning: serotonin, dopamine
  2. Storage: serotonin, dopamine
1. Decision making/reward processing:
  2. Confidence: serotonin
  2. Satisfaction: serotonin
  2. Motivation, wanting: dopamine
  2. Risky choices inclination: noradrenaline
  2. Number of options to process: noradrenaline

There are two groups of parameters:

###Generic

*CPU power*: distribution and priority of parallel process or load balancing, is impacted by noradrenaline: the higher is noradrenaline more computing power must be concentrated on current activity (neuromodulator regulating attention).

*Working memory(short term)* distribution and concentration is impacted by noradrenaline (attention).

*Learning* is impacted by serotonin and dopamine: dopamine plays major role in activation of previously remembered patterns and serotonin in pattern generation.

*Storage* management (long term memory) is impacted by both by serotonin and dopamine, higher concentrations of both neuromodulators makes system better remember stimulus.

###Decision making

This decision making is done mainly in deliberation and learned reaction layers of model of six.
Parameters: confidence, satisfaction, risky are used to highlight actions stored(remembered).

*Confidence and satisfaction* of the system is directly influenced by serotonin.

System is more *motivated* under influence of dopamine.

System tends to choose *risky* actions under impact of noradrenaline.

Noradrenaline makes system use less *number of options* in width and depth to be processed during deliberation.

This mapping is exhaustively described in [computational_emotional_thinking]. It could be used as low level("hard-coded") model of emotional processes implemented in the model of spiking neuron used to build the self-emergent neural network and could be used as basic framework for the emotion enabled systems [whatdoesitmeanforcomputer].

##Appraisal and coping 

Model described above operates in thinking processes environment, surrounded mainly by appraisal and coping processes. We classify two types of appraisal processes mentioned above: non-conscious (quick, low level) and conscious (slower, high level) appraisals.

###Non-conscious appraisals 

Non-conscious appraisals are associated with instinctive reactions layer of model of six, actually are performed in spinal cord, hypothalamus and amygdala and has innate nature formed during evolution. We used Tomkins theory of affects as base for non-conscious emotional reactions [primer_affect_psychology]. Main criteria used for evaluation is activity level of CNS that could be steady, increasing, decreasing. Thus appraisal is described as following:

1. Moderate steady CNS activity triggers **distress/anguish**, while high steady activity triggers **anger/rage**, both of them negative. It worth to note that the higher distress CNS activity the easier is switch to anger. We could interpret this as following: the longer the person is in distress state the easier he/she could be switched to anger state.
1. Decrease of CNS activity is considered as relief and triggers **enjoyment/joy**.
1. "**Disgust** NEGATIVE affect is inherently punishing and provides us some protection against eating poisonous or rotten food." We consider this affect as unconditional rejection of inbound stimulus as something directly damaging the system. This could be understood as low level hard-coded predicate to protect system.
1. **Shame/humiliation** "affect is neither inherently punishing nor rewarding. It is like a computer’s reset button that rapidly clears the system and prepares us for whatever comes next... Without the innate affect shame-humiliation, we would not be motivated to take action when we are deprived of interesting and enjoyable things." This complex affect that appeared to be latest in evolutional process of humans is triggered when system was prevented to get new interesting information.

###Conscious appraisal

Conscious appraisal has more complex self-emergent nature and is based on nurture and education of a child. We used [appraisal_considered_as_a_process] as base for conscious appraisal process and derive patterns for Plutchik "Wheel of emotion" model of emotions. Please see for complete list of patterns(probabilistic predicates): https://github.com/development-team/2/blob/master/doc/emotions/affective%20and%20appraisal%20aspects/appraisal_coping_high_level_emotions_aspects.md#comprehensive-secs-structure.
Scherer used uses 16 Stimulus Evaluation Checks(SEC) as basic blocks for whole appraisal processes. And overall process looks like following sequence:

1. Relevance check including: novelty check, intrinsic pleasantness check, goal relevance check.
1. Implication check including: causal attribution check, outcome probability check, discrepancy from expectation check, goal/need conduciveness check, urgency check.
1. Coping potential including: control check, power check, adjustment check.
1. Normative significance including: internal standards check, external standards check.

This could be understood as algorithm for conscious appraisal done within 5 levels of "Model of six" [emotionmachine]: learned reactions, deliberative thinking, reflective thinking, self-reflective thinking, self-conscious reflections layers. 

###Coping

There are two main types of coping strategies: emotion-focused and problem focused copings. We discovered relation of coping strategy selection with gender [sex_differencies] based on oxytocin stress hormone activity that is amplified by estrogen. This effect could makes woman select more social coping strategies.
The example of emotion-focused coping is placed in Emotional feedback loops section.
Example of problem-focused coping is presented below:

![problem focused coping](coping_agi.png)

Stimulus triggers affective appraisal and neuromodulation that switches emotional state of the system from serenity to fear. Affective appraisal in its turn triggers cognitive appraisal with appraisal deliberation. This cognition and deliberation makes system select problem-focused coping (planning) this selection is done under influence of reflective thinking. After planning is done system implements created plan and applies it over the environment. Effect in environment is appraised as new stimulus and could cause new neuromodulation that switches emotional state of the system back from fear to serenity.

##High level and low level emotions

Robert Plutchik [natureofemotions] identifies 8 higher emotions, see Emotional feedback loops section. We suppose that this emotions should be represented as mixture of neuromodulators levels of basic emotions. According to Plutchik higher emotions are combinations of basic emotions is the same manner as mixture of colors. Based on Lovheim model of neuromodulators relative levels and Gaussian nature of relation of subjective emotions perception to objective brain response [senticcomputing, neuralcorrelatesofhate] we propose following mapping of high level emotions on neuromodulators levels:

1. **G(Optimism Intensity)** = 1.0 serotonin  + 1.0 dopamine + 0.5 noradrenaline;
1. **G(Love Intensity)** = 0.75 serotonin + 1.0 dopamine + 0.0 noradrenaline;
1. **G(Submission Intensity)** = 0.25 serotonin + 1.0 dopamine + 0.0 noradrenaline;
1. **G(Awe Intensity)** = 0.5 serotonin + 0.5 dopamine + 0.5 noradrenaline;
1. **G(Disapproval Intensity)** = 0.5 serotonin + 0.0 dopamine + 1.0 noradrenaline;
1. **G(Remorse Intensity)** = 0.0 serotonin + 0.0 dopamine + 0.0 noradrenaline;
1. **G(Contempt Intensity)** = 0.5 serotonin + 0.5 dopamine + 0.5 noradrenaline;
1. **G(Aggressiveness Intensity)** = 0.5 serotonin + 1.0 dopamine + 1.0 noradrenaline;

This could be understood as basic mechanism for self-reflective thinking and self-conscious reflections layers influence on neuromodulation.
