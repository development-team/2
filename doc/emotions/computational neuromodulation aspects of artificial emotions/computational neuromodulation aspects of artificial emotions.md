#Computational neuromodulation aspects of artificial emotions

Describe details of neuromodulators mapping to parameters of computing system:

1. Generic:
  2. CPU power: noradrenaline
  2. Memory distribution (attention): noradrenaline
  2. Learning: serotonin, dopamine
  2. Storage: serotonin, dopamine
1. Decision making/reward processing:
  2. Confidence: serotonin
  2. Satisfaction: serotonin
  2. Motivation, wanting: dopamine
  2. Risky choices inclination: noradrenaline
  2. Number of options to process: noradrenaline

Parameters are grouped in two folders: most obvious computing system parameters (generic):
*CPU power*(computing processes distribution or load balancing) is influenced by noradrenaline the higher is noradrenaline more computing processes should be concentrated on current activity.
*Working memory(short term)* distribution is influenced by noradrenaline as neurotransmitter regulating attention.
*Learning* is impacted by serotonin and dopamine: dopamine plays major role in activation of previously remembered patterns and serotonin in pattern generation.
*Storage* management (long term memory) is influenced both by serotonin and dopamine, higher concentrations of both neurotransmitters the better action is remembered(less probability to forget).

Second group contains parameters that influence decision making in probabilistic reasoning system. This reasoning is done mainly in deliberation and learned reaction layers.
Parameters: confidence, satisfaction, risky are used to highlight actions stored(remembered).
*Confidence and satisfaction* of the system is directly influenced by serotonin higher serotonin more confident is the system.
System is more *motivated* under influence of dopamine.
System tends to choose *risky* actions under impact of noradrenaline.
Noradrenaline makes system use less *number of options* in width and depth to be processed during reasoning.
