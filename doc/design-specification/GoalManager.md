# GoalManager design specification

Goal manager is a critic that analyses [context](https://github.com/development-team/2/blob/master/doc/design-specification/create-context-way2Think.md) and triggers a [goal](https://github.com/development-team/2/blob/master/doc/design-specification/goal.md).
Triggered goal is choosen by the algorithm described in [Training](https://github.com/development-team/2/blob/master/doc/design-specification/training.md) and based on train data.

To know more about goal plase see [Goal](https://github.com/development-team/2/blob/master/doc/design-specification/goal.md)

Training is described in [Training](https://github.com/development-team/2/blob/master/doc/design-specification/training.md)

### Input
A processing context

### Output

Triggered goal.
If GoalManager cannot choose next goal it should execute [CryForHelp](https://github.com/development-team/2/blob/master/doc/design-specification/cry4help-way2Think.md)

### Goals list

1. Preprocess incident
2. Classify incident
3. Generate solution

### Rules

The rules to trigger goals should be something like this:

1. Preprocess incident -> if it is a first time when GoalManager is runned for the request.
2. Classify incident -> after preprocess incident and the context contains data generated by preprocessors (i.e. Preprocess Manager)
3. Generate solution -> after classify incident and the context contains data generated by classifiers
