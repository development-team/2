##Other types of neurons

* Basket cells, interneurons that form a dense plexus of terminals around the soma of target cells, found in the cortex and cerebellum.
* Betz cells, large motor neurons.
* Lugaro cells, interneurons of the cerebellum.
* Medium spiny neurons, most neurons in the corpus striatum.
* Purkinje cells, huge neurons in the cerebellum, a type of Golgi I multipolar neuron.
* Pyramidal cells, neurons with triangular soma, a type of Golgi I.
* Renshaw cells, neurons with both ends linked to alpha motor neurons.
* Unipolar brush cells, interneurons with unique dendrite ending in a brush-like tuft.
* Granule cells, a type of Golgi II neuron.
* Anterior horn cells, motoneurons located in the spinal cord.
* Spindle cells, interneurons that connect widely separated areas of the brain

##IPSP

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_postsynaptic_potential

In general, a postsynaptic potential is dependent on the type and combination of receptor channel, reverse potential of the postsynaptic potential, action potential threshold voltage, ionic permeability of the ion channel, as well as the concentrations of the ions in and out of the cell; this determines if it is excitatory or inhibitory. IPSPs always want to keep the membrane potential more negative than the action potential threshold and can be seen as a transient hyperpolarization.[3] EPSPs and IPSPs compete with each other at numerous synapses of a neuron; this determines whether or not the action potential at the presynaptic terminal will regenerate at the postsynaptic membrane. Some common neurotransmitters involved in IPSPs are GABA and glycine.

##EPSP

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitatory_postsynaptic_potential

In neuroscience, an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is a temporary depolarization of postsynaptic membrane potential caused by the flow of positively charged ions into the postsynaptic cell as a result of opening of ligand-gated ion channels. They are the opposite of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), which usually result from the flow of negative ions into the cell or positive ions out of the cell. A postsynaptic potential is defined as excitatory if it makes the neuron more likely to fire an action potential. EPSPs can also result from a decrease in outgoing positive charges, while IPSPs are sometimes caused by an increase in positive charge outflow. The flow of ions that causes an EPSP is an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC).

EPSPs, like IPSPs, are graded (i.e. they have an additive effect). When multiple EPSPs occur on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, their combined effect is the sum of the individual EPSPs. Larger EPSPs result in greater membrane depolarization and thus increase the likelihood that the postsynaptic cell reaches the threshold for firing an action potential.

##Action potential

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_potential

In physiology, an action potential is a short-lasting event in which the electrical membrane potential of a cell rapidly rises and falls, following a consistent trajectory. Action potentials occur in several types of animal cells, called excitable cells, which include neurons, muscle cells, and endocrine cells, as well as in some plant cells. In neurons, they play a central role in cell-to-cell communication. In other types of cells, their main function is to activate intracellular processes. In muscle cells, for example, an action potential is the first step in the chain of events leading to contraction. In beta cells of the pancreas, they provoke release of insulin.[1] Action potentials in neurons are also known as "nerve impulses" or "spikes", and the temporal sequence of action potentials generated by a neuron is called its "spike train". A neuron that emits an action potential is often said to "fire"

##The neuron doctrine

[21] Witcher M, Kirov S, Harris K (2007). "Plasticity of perisynaptic astroglia during synaptogenesis in the mature rat hippocampus". Glia 55 (1): 13–23. doi:10.1002/glia.20415. PMID 17001633.

The neuron doctrine is the now fundamental idea that neurons are the basic structural and functional units of the nervous system. The theory was put forward by Santiago Ramón y Cajal in the late 19th century. It held that neurons are discrete cells (not connected in a meshwork), acting as metabolically distinct units.

Later discoveries yielded a few refinements to the simplest form of the doctrine. For example, glial cells, which are not considered neurons, play an essential role in information processing.[21] Also, electrical synapses are more common than previously thought,[22] meaning that there are direct, cytoplasmic connections between neurons. In fact, there are examples of neurons forming even tighter coupling: the squid giant axon arises from the fusion of multiple axons.[23]

Ramón y Cajal also postulated the Law of Dynamic Polarization, which states that a neuron receives signals at its dendrites and cell body and transmits them, as action potentials, along the axon in one direction: away from the cell body.[24] The Law of Dynamic Polarization has important exceptions; dendrites can serve as synaptic output sites of neurons[25] and axons can receive synaptic inputs.[26]

##Neurons in brain

[28] Azevedo FA, Carvalho LR, Grinberg LT, et al. (April 2009). "Equal numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells make the human brain an isometrically scaled-up primate brain". The Journal of Comparative Neurology 513 (5): 532–41. doi:10.1002/cne.21974. PMID 19226510.

The number of neurons in the brain varies dramatically from species to species.[27] One estimate (published in 1988) puts the human brain at about 100 billion (1011) neurons and 100 trillion (1014) synapses.[27] A lower estimate (published in 2009) is **86 billion neurons**, of which **16.3 billion are in the cerebral cortex**, and **69 billion in the cerebellum**.[28] By contrast, the **nematode** worm Caenorhabditis elegans has just **302 neurons**, making it an ideal experimental subject as scientists have been able to map all of the organism's neurons. The fruit fly **Drosophila melanogaster**, a common subject in biological experiments, has around **100,000 neurons** and exhibits many complex behaviors. **Many properties of neurons, from the type of neurotransmitters used to ion channel composition, are maintained across species, allowing scientists to study processes occurring in more complex organisms in much simpler experimental systems.**

##Nerve regeneration

It has been demonstrated that neurogenesis can sometimes occur in the adult vertebrate brain, a finding that led to controversy in 1999.[29] However, more recent studies of the age of human neurons suggest that this process occurs only for a minority of cells, and the overwhelming majority of neurons comprising the neocortex were formed before birth and persist without replacement.[2]

It is often possible for peripheral axons to regrow if they are severed. Recent studies have also shown that the body contains a variety of stem cell types that have the capacity to differentiate into neurons. A report in Nature suggested that researchers had found a way to transform human skin cells into working nerve cells using a process called transdifferentiation in which "cells are forced to adopt new identities".[30]
