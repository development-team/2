#Metabotropic receptor

##Function

Metabotropic receptors have neurotransmitters as ligands, which, when bound to the receptors, initiate cascades that can lead to channel-opening or other cellular effects. When a ligand (the neurotransmitter) binds to the receptor (the transducer) the latter activates a primary effector via the G-protein, which can go on to activate secondary messengers or have other effects. Since opening channels by metabotropic receptors involves activating a number of molecules in turn, channels associated with these receptors take longer to open than ionotropic receptors do, and they are thus not involved in mechanisms that require quick responses.[3]:240 However, metabotropic receptors also remain open from seconds to minutes.[3]:250–1 Thus they have a much longer-lasting effect than ionotropic receptors, which open quickly but only remain open for a few milliseconds.[1] While ionotropic channels have an effect only in the immediate region of the receptor, the effects of metabotropic receptors can be more widespread through the cell.
Metabotropic receptors can both open and close channels. They can make a membrane more excitable by closing K+ channels, retaining positive charge within the cell and thus reducing the amount of current necessary to cause an action potential.[3]:242–3 Metabotropic receptors on the presynaptic membrane can inhibit or, more rarely, facilitate neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic neuron.[4] These receptors can be further classified into receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors, or GPCRs.[3]:229
