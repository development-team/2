* Affect Any information (emotion, feeling, mood) used to inform one or more cognitive processes
* Appraisal The process of making judgments (appraisals) about the relationship between perceived
events and one’s beliefs, desires, and intentions (Lazarus, 1991
* Cognition Mental processes that have to do with the acquisition, alteration, and comprehension of
knowledge; such as recall, inference, learning, and planning
* Emotion Cognitive data arising from events (internal and external) used to inform responses, and
attributed to concepts and states
* Feeling The subjective experience of an emotion or set of emotions
* Mood An overall state of emotion which is sustained over longer periods of time and is less changeable than emotions themselves
