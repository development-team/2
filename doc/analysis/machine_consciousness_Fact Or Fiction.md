#Machine Consciousness: Fact Or Fiction analysis.

##Defining the Mystery of Consciousness

1. a feeling of presence within an external world,
2. the ability to remember previous experiences accurately, or even imagine events that have not happened,
3. the ability to decide where to direct my focus,
4. knowledge of the options open to me in the future, and
5. the capacity to decide what actions to take.

Unfortunately, the AI created over the last 60 years largely ignored the mental world we call consciousness. Today’s machines don’t have minds of their own; their so-called intelligence is achieved through the blood, sweat, and tears of armies of brilliant human programmers. Humans write the indispensable rules that cause machines to recognize sounds, respond to visual patterns, take the next move at chess, and even suggest which shares to buy on the stock market.

##Building Conscious Machines
VisAw’s only built-in features are the abilities to look around a face, to receive a single-word name for the image, and to switch attention from an observational to an imaginational mode. In humans, the coexistence of these two modes allows us to use our visual perception (for example, looking around a room for a pair of eye-glasses) while we also visually imagine things (like what the glasses look like). A machine can be said to be “imagining” when, in the networks that produce a sensation of “seeing” objects in the world, objects or scenes appear that have been seen in the past or perhaps have never been seen before. The display indicates that the machine “knows” that it is mainly imagining because neural activity between the external drive (perception) and internal drive (imagination) can be detected and displayed as a label on the screen. In VisAw, the imagination behavior can be triggered by voice input or can emerge arbitrarily.

##Replicating The Mind’s Eye
So should we consider VisAw conscious? We can evaluate its activities in terms of the five axioms of consciousness I laid out previously:

1. The machine was not given any rules, but was able to create its own internal states that represented the faces I exposed it to, thus demonstrating the inner awareness of the external world demanded by axiom one.
2. As described in axiom two, the machine’s inner states include an imagination mode created from neural activity representations of past experiences.
3. A process of attention controls the movement of the machine’s “eye,” as demanded by axiom three.(c)
