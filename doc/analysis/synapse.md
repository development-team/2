#Synapse and neurotransmission analysis

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synaptic_transmission

##Stages of neurotransmission at synapse

1. Synthesis of the neurotransmitter. This can take place in the cell body, in the axon, or in the axon terminal.
1. Storage of the neurotransmitter in storage granules or vesicles in the axon terminal.
1. Calcium enters the axon terminal during an action potential, causing release of the neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft.
1. After its release, the transmitter binds to and activates a receptor in the postsynaptic membrane.
1. Deactivation of the neurotransmitter. The neurotransmitter is either destroyed enzymatically, or taken back into the terminal from which it came, where it can be reused, or degraded and removed.

##Convergence and divergence

Neurotransmission implies both a convergence and a divergence of information. First one neuron is influenced by many others, resulting in a convergence of input. When the neuron fires, the signal is sent to many other neurons, resulting in a divergence of output. Many other neurons are influenced by this neuron.[4]

##Cotransmission

Cotransmission is the release of several types of neurotransmitters from a single nerve terminal. At the nerve terminal, neurotransmitters are present within 35–50 nm membrane-encased vesicles called synaptic vesicles. To release neurotransmitters, the synaptic vesicles transiently dock and fuse at the base of specialized 10–15 nm cup-shaped lipoprotein structures at the presynaptic membrane called porosomes.[5] The neuronal porosome proteome has been solved, providing the molecular architecture and the complete composition of the machinery.[6]
