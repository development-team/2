Appraisal theorists typically view appraisal as the cause of emotion, or at least of the physiological, behavioral and cognitive changes associated with emotion. 

Indeed, although appraisal theorists allow that the same situation may elicit multiple appraisals, theorists are relatively silent on how these individual appraisals would combine into an overall emotional state or if this state is best represented by discrete motor programs 
or more dimensional representations. More recent work has begun to examine the processing 
constraints underlying appraisal – to what extent is it parallel or sequential (Moors et al., 2005, Scherer, 
2001)? does it occur at multiple levels (Scherer, 2001, Smith and Kirby, 2000)? – and creating a better 
understanding of the cognitive, situational and dispositional factors that influence appraisal judgments 
(Smith and Kirby, 2009, Kuppens and Van Mechelen, 2007).

Many computational dimensional models build on the three-dimensional “PAD” 
model of Mehrabian and Russell (1974) where these dimensions correspond to pleasure (a measure of 
valence), arousal (indicating the level of affective activation) and dominance (a measure of power or 
control). 

Dimensional theorists conceive of core affect as a “non-intentional” state, meaning the affect 
is not about some object (as in “I am angry at him). In such theories, many factors may contribute to a 
change in core affect including symbolic intentional judgments (e.g., appraisal) but also sub-symbolic 
factors such as hormones and drugs (Schachter and Singer, 1962), but most importantly, the link 
between any preceding intentional meaning and emotion is broken (as it is not represented within core 
affect) and must be recovered after the fact, sometimes incorrectly (Clore and Plamer, 2009, Clore et al., 
1994).
