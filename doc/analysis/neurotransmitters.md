## Name
[Agmatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agmatine)

##Metabotropic
α2 adrenergic receptor Imidazoline receptor 

##Ionotropic
NMDA receptor

##Functions

It is synthesized in the brain, stored in synaptic vesicles, accumulated by uptake, released by membrane depolarization, and inactivated by agmatinase. Agmatine **binds to α2-adrenergic receptor and imidazoline receptor binding sites**, and **blocks NMDA receptors** and other cation ligand-gated channels. Agmatine inhibits or inactivates nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and it induces the release of some peptide hormones.
