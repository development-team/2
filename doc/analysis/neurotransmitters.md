##[Agmatine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agmatine)

###Category

Small: Amino acids (Arg)|

###Metabotropic

α2 adrenergic receptor Imidazoline receptor 

###Ionotropic

NMDA receptor

###Functions

It is synthesized in the brain, stored in synaptic vesicles, accumulated by uptake, released by membrane depolarization, and inactivated by agmatinase. Agmatine **binds to α2-adrenergic receptor and imidazoline receptor binding sites**, and **blocks NMDA receptors** and other cation ligand-gated channels. Agmatine inhibits or inactivates nitric oxide synthase (NOS), and it induces the release of some peptide hormones.

##[Aspartate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate)

###Category

Small: Amino acids

###Ionotropic

NMDA receptor

###Functions

Aspartate (the conjugate base of aspartic acid) stimulates NMDA receptors, though not as strongly as the amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate does.[6]

##[Glutamate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate)

###Category

Small: Amino acids

###Metabotropic

Metabotropic glutamate receptor

###Ionotropic

NMDA receptor (co-agonist), Kainate receptor, AMPA receptor

###Functions
