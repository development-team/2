## Criteria list:

1. Compatible with model of six
1. Compatibel with Plutchick theory 
1. Compatible with Tomkins theory
1. Structure
1. Process 
1. Continuous

## Structural model

### Criteria:

1. Compatibile with model of six (no levels of processing) = 0.5
1. Compatibel with Plutchick theory 
1. Compatible with Tomkins theory
1. Structure = 1
1. Process = 0
1. Continuous - 0 

### Lit

1. Lazarus, Richard S. (1991). Progress on a cognitive-motivational-relational theory of Emotion. American Psychologist, 46(8), 819-834.

### Primary appraisal

* **motivational relevance**: “How relevant is this situation to my needs?”
* **motivational congruence**: “Is this situation congruent or incongruent (consistent or inconsistent) with my goals?”

### Secondary appraisal

* **resources**: who should be held accountable
* **options for coping**: problem-focused coping , emotion-focused coping
* **future expectancy**

## Two process appraisal

### Criteria

1. Compatibile with model of six (no levels of processing) = 1
1. Compatibel with Plutchick theory 
1. Compatible with Tomkins theory
1. Structure = 1
1. Process = 1
1. Continuous - 1

### Processes

1. **Perceptual stimuli** are what the individual picks up from his or her surroundings, such as sensations of pain or pleasure, perception of facial expression
1. **Associative processing** is a memory-based process that makes quick connections.
1. **Reasoning** is a slower, more deliberate, and thorough process that involves logical, critical thinking.

Two-process model of appraisal theory, associative processing and reasoning work in parallel.

##  Multi-level Sequential Check Model

### Criteria

1. Compatibile with model of six (no levels of processing) = 1
1. Compatibel with Plutchick theory 
1. Compatible with Tomkins theory
1. Structure = 1
1. Process = 1
1. Continuous - 1

### Levels of processing

1. innate (sensory-motor)
1. learned (schema-based)
1. deliberate (conceptual)


### Sensory evaluation checks

1. **relevance** (novelty and relevance to goals) check, 
2. **implication check** (cause, goal conduciveness, and urgency)
3. **coping potential** check (control and power)
4. **normative significance** (compatibility with one’s standards) 

While the two-process model involves processes occurring at the same time, parallel to one another, Scherer’s multi-level sequential check model is composed of processes that take place in a specific sequence.
