1. Part of normal brain function evolved to reduce stimulus confusion. 
1. Nothing becomes conscious unless an affect is triggered first. 
1. Each affect is triggered by a specific stimulus condition or pattern. 
1. Affect is information about stimulus conditions. 
1. Positive affect is inherently rewarding,negative affect inherently punishing. 
1. The NINE innate affects—POSITIVE * NEUTRAL * NEGATIVE—are:
  1. Surprise (neutral)
  1. Interest (positive)
  1. Joy (positive)
  1. Fear (negative)
  1. Distress (negative)
  1. Anger (negative)
  1. Disgust (negative)

1. INTEREST-EXCITEMENT:  eyebrows down, eyes track,  look,  listen 
2. ENJOYMENT-JOY:  smile, lips widened up and out, smiling eyes  (circular  wrinkles) 
3. SURPRISE-STARTLE:  eyebrows up, eyes blink 
4. DISTRESS-ANGUISH:  cry, arched  eyebrows, mouth down, tears, rhythmic sobbing 
5. FEAR-TERROR:  eyes frozen open, pale,  cold, sweaty, facial  trembling,  with  hair erect 
6. SHAME-HUMILIATION:  eyes down, head down 
7. CONTEMPT-DISGUST:  sneer, upper lip up 
8. ANGER-RAGE:  frown, clenched jaw,  eyes  narrowed, red  face 

These facial affective responses we assume are controlled by innate affect 
programs which are inherited as  a sub-cortical scrucrure which can inscruct and 
concrol a variety of muscles and glands to respond with unique patterns of rate 
and duration of activity characteristic of a given affect.  These innate responses 
are later  transformed  in  various ways through learning, but there is always a 
continuing openness to activation of the innate pattern of responses.
