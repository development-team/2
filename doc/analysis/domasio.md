#Emotion in the perspective of an integrated nervous system.

##2. Emotion and feeling

The term emotion should be rightfully used to designate a collection of responses triggered from parts of the brain to the body, and from parts of the brain to other parts of the brain, using both neural and humoral routes. The end result of the collection of such responses is an **emotional state**, defined by changes within the body-proper, e.g., viscera, internal milieu, and within certain sectors of the brain, e.g., somatosensory cortices; neuro-transmitter nuclei in brain stem.
The term feeling should be used to describe the complex **mental state** that results from the emotional state.That mental state includes: 

1. the representation of the changes that have just occurred in the body-proper and are being signaled to body-representing structures in the central nervous system (or have been implemented entirely in somatosensory structures via ‘as-if-body-loops’); and it also includes
1. a number of alterations in cognitive processing that are caused by signals secondary to brain- to-brain responses, for instance, signals from neurotransmitter nuclei towards varied sites in telencephalon.

Both emotions and feelings are amenable to investigation, all the more so if their sequential and concurrent functional components can be relatively individualized for analysis along the model suggested by the above distinction. Emotion is somewhat more accessible than feeling because the triggering stimuli and sites are easier to identify, and because so many of the responses are externalized and thus easier to measure. But once the neural systems which can support feelings are identified, feelings are also accessible, especially in humans, using modern neuroimaging tools.
