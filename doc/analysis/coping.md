# Coping

Folkman and Lazarus identified five emotion-focused coping strategies:[10]

1. disclaiming
1. escape-avoidance
1. accepting responsibility or blame
1. exercising self-control
1. positive reappraisal

and three problem-focused coping strategies: seeking social support and "taking action to try to get rid of the problem is a problem-focused strategy, but so is making a list of the steps to take".[8]

Lazarus "notes the connection between his idea of 'defensive reappraisals' or cognitive coping and Freud's concept of 'ego-defenses'",[10] coping strategies thus overlapping with a person's defense mechanisms.
