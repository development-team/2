## Appraisal theory

Appraisal theorists typically view appraisal as the cause of emotion, or at least of the physiological, behavioral and cognitive changes associated with emotion. 

## Dimensional Theories 

Interestingly, we are not aware of any computational models that follow the suggestion from Zajonc and Russell that appraisal is a post hoc explanation of core affect.

ZAJONC, R. B. (1980) Feeling and thinking: Preferences need no inferences. American Psychologist, 35, 151-175.

## Anatomic approaches:

Computational models inspired by the anatomic tradition often focus on low-level, perceptual-motor tasks and encode a two-process view of emotion that argues for a **fast, automatic, undifferentiated emotional response** and a **slower, more differentiated response** that relies on higher level reasoning processes (e.g., Armony et al., 1997).

emotion: Explorations through the anatomy and physiology of fear conditioning. Trends in Cognitive Science, 1, 28-34.

## Rational approaches

AI and logic based.

## Communicative approaches

Communicative theories of emotion argue that emotion processes 
function as a communicative system; both as a mechanism for informing other individuals of one’s mental state –  and thereby facilitate social coordination  –  and as a mechanism for requesting/demanding changes in the behavior of others – as in threat displays (Keltner and Haidt, 1999, Parkinson, 2009).

## Processing Assumptions

### Representational Specificity

Some further decompose appraisal checks into the representational details (e.g., domain propositions, actions, and the causal relationships 
between them) that are necessary for an agent to appraise its relationship to the environment (e.g., El 
Nasr et al., 2000, Gratch and Marsella, 2004a, Neal Reilly, 1996, Si et al., 2008, Mao and Gratch, 2006, 
Dias and Paiva, 2005, Becker-Asano, 2008).

Sander and colleagues (2005) provide a detailed neural network model of how appraisals are derived from the 
person-environment relationship, but the person-environment relationship itself is only abstractly 
represented. 

### Domain specific vs. Domain independent
Computational appraisal models differ in terms 
of how domain-specific knowledge is encoded and which components require domain-specific  input. 
Most systems incorporate domain-independent affect-derivation models (Marinier, 2008, Becker-Asano, 
2008, Gratch and Marsella, 2004a, Gebhard, 2005, Neal Reilly, 1996, Bui, 2004). Fewer systems provide 
domain-independent algorithms for appraisal-derivation (e.g., Gratch and Marsella, 2004a, Neal Reilly, 
1996, Si et al., 2008, El Nasr et al., 2000).  


# Example applications of this framework

1. EMA = Richard Lazarus (Lazarus, 1991)
1. ALMA is intended as a general programming tool to allow application developers to more easily construct 
computational models of emotion for a variety of applications (Gebhard, 2005).

Other researchers have explored how emotions might improve the decisionmaking capabilities of general models of intelligence (Scheutz and Sloman, 2001, Ito et al., 2008)
