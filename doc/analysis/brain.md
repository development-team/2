1. Punishment
1. Learning

###RAS (reticular activating system)

1. Relaxation -> alertness 
1. Novelty learning
1. Focus
1. Attention
1. Novelty check
1. Maintains consciousness
1. Information filter

###Hippocampus

1. Glucocorticoid
1. Short term memory -> long term memory
1. Associative learning
1. Spatial memory
1. Long term stress
1. Sleep

###Corpus callosum

1. Thick band of nerves
1. Communication of hemispheres
1. Cognitive functions
1. Motor functions
1. Sensory functions
1. Oral language
1. Language structures
1. Reading
1. Concepts of print
1. Handwriting
1. Movement of your eyes
1. Making sense of speech
1. Music practice

###Amygdala

1. Information filter
1. Worried thoughts
1. Fight-or-flight survival mechanism

1. External threat only
1. Mirror neurons

Amygdala passes the message to the hippocampus, which then routes the message to memory and action centres which help initiate responses and activate coping mechanisms.

###Thalamus
