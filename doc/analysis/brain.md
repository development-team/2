##Limbic system

###Basal ganglia

1. Dopamine 
1. Rewards
1. Punishment
1. Learning

###RAS (reticular activating system)

1. Relaxation -> alertness 
1. Novelty learning
1. Focus
1. Attention
1. Novelty check
1. Maintains consciousness
1. Information filter

###Hippocampus

1. Glucocorticoid
1. Short term memory -> long term memory
1. Associative learning
1. Spatial memory
1. Long term stress
1. Sleep

###Corpus callosum

1. Thick band of nerves
1. Communication of hemispheres
