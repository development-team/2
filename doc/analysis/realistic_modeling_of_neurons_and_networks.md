##Circuit modeling

Microcircuits can generate complex spatiotemporal dynamics making it possible to perform signal processing and recoding and to store information through long-term synaptic plasticity. As a result the microcircuits display a variety of emerging properties ranging from learning to pattern recognition, categorization and generalization, reflecting abstraction and the formation of the concept of objects. All these features have previously been reproduced using various ad hoc simplified neural networks, but none was able to perform all these tasks ( Spitzer, 1998 ).

##The cerebellum as a prototype of realistic network simulation

It is important to note that the cerebellum plays a key role in timing, learning and sensory prediction ( Ivry and Baldo, 1992; Ivry et al., 2002; Ivry and Spencer, 2004) (see Box 2 for details). Simulating all these functions requires a closed-loop circuit integrating the motor cortex, several motor nuclei and motor structures. In order to proceed in this direction, simplified models have been generated and adapted from the realistic models ( Fig. 4  ). These simplified models can be either analogical or spiking and can run in real time. They are suitable for integration into a robotic simulator or into a real robot ( Fig.s 5  , 6  ), and can therefore allow the cerebellar network to be studied in closed-loop conditions. In this manner, the impact of the salient network parameters (including ion channels, synaptic receptors, network connections, neuronal types and plasticity rules) on network computations and behavior can be tested.

##The cerebellum: circuit properties and system integration

The deep cerebellar nucleus emits the output and at the same time inhibits the inferior olive.

The cerebellar cortical circuit is organized as a feedforward excitatory chain assisted by inhibitory loops: mf excite GrC, which activate all the other cortical elements. In the granular layer, inhibition is provided by GoC, in the molecular layer by SC and BC. Finally, PC inhibit deep cerebellar nuclei. The inferior olive, which is also activated by brain stem and spinal cord nuclei, controls PC activity though a single powerful synapse. Thus, the whole system can be seen as a complex mechanism controlling deep cerebellar nucleus output. (From Dâ€™Angelo and Casali, 2013).

More precisely, a copy of motor commands generated by the motor cortex (efference copy) is sent to the cerebellum, which uses its internal forward model to predict their sensory consequences (corollary discharge). The sensory predictions are then compared to actual sensory feedback ( Wolpert et al., 1998): in the presence of errors (or novelty, i.e., deviations from prediction), the cerebellum emits corrective signals. A fully characterized example of generation of predictions by cerebellar circuits is provided by electro-perception in weakly electric fishes, in which a cerebellar-like structure compares the expected electric field generated by the fish with the actual electric field sensed by the electroreceptors, thus gaining information on the structure of the environment through the changes that this latter has caused in the field itself ( Bell et al., 2008).
