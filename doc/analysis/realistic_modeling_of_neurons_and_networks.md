Microcircuits can generate complex spatiotemporal dynamics making it possible to perform signal processing and recoding and to store information through long-term synaptic plasticity. As a result the microcircuits display a variety of emerging properties ranging from learning to pattern recognition, categorization and generalization, reflecting abstraction and the formation of the concept of objects. All these features have previously been reproduced using various ad hoc simplified neural networks, but none was able to perform all these tasks ( Spitzer, 1998 ).
