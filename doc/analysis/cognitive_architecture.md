##4CAPS

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4CAPS

Notably, 4CAPS differs from other architectures for its stress on the capacity constraints (that is, limited computational power), and the dynamic collaboration between different centers. In particular, according the Just and Varma,[1] 4CAPS is based on four characteristic assumptions:

1. Each cortical area can perform multiple cognitive functions
1. Each cortical area has a limited capacity of computational resources
1. The cortical network of regions that is responsible for carrying out a particular task changes dynamically as the regions' capacity resources are saturated.
1. Communications between cortical regions is also subject to specific constraints, similar to bandwidth limitations along information channels.

##ACT-R


## CopyCat

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycat_(software)

Main features:

1. analogy is main mechanism of higher cognition
2. **slipnet** the associative network, built on pre-programmed concepts and their associations (a long-term memory);
3. **working area** (also called workspace, similar to blackboard systems); 
4. **coderack** (with the **codelets**); high-level perception emerges from the spreading activity of many independent processes, called codelets, running in parallel, competing or cooperating.
