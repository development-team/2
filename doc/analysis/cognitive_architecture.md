##4CAPS

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4CAPS

Notably, 4CAPS differs from other architectures for its stress on the capacity constraints (that is, limited computational power), and the dynamic collaboration between different centers. In particular, according the Just and Varma,[1] 4CAPS is based on four characteristic assumptions:

1. Each cortical area can perform multiple cognitive functions
1. Each cortical area has a limited capacity of computational resources
1. The cortical network of regions that is responsible for carrying out a particular task changes dynamically as the regions' capacity resources are saturated.
1. Communications between cortical regions is also subject to specific constraints, similar to bandwidth limitations along information channels.

##ACT-R

There are two types of modules:
1. Perceptual-motor modules, which take care of the interface with the real world (i.e., with a simulation of the real world). The most well-developed perceptual-motor modules in ACT-R are the visual and the manual modules.
1. Memory modules. There are two kinds of memory modules in ACT-R:
  2. Declarative memory, consisting of facts such as Washington, D.C. is the capital of United States, France is a country in Europe, or 2+3=5
  2. Procedural memory, made of productions. Productions represent knowledge about how we do things: for instance, knowledge about how to type the letter "Q" on a keyboard, about how to drive, or about how to perform addition.

##ASMO

http://cfsites1.uts.edu.au/feit/it/students/profiles/detail.cfm?ItemId=25175
http://www.ronynovianto.com/publications/the_role_of_attention_in_robot_self-awareness.pdf

To support self-modification capabilities in a self-modifying robot, I have been developing a robot architecture called ASMO. This enables the use of multiple representations and allows the robot to perform complex tasks. ASMO has been implemented in a few different robots including Smokey and Nao. Smokey is a robot bear that was designed for social robot interaction. The challenge is to bring Smokey to life, including giving him emotions and self-awareness. Smokey’s emotional response is developed in ASMO. For example, he can now recognise his favourite colour and gets excited when he sees a red coloured object.

##CHREST

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHREST_(cognitive_architecture)

http://chrest.info/design.html

CHREST (Chunk Hierarchy and REtrieval STructures) is a symbolic cognitive architecture based on the concepts of limited attention, limited short-term memories, and chunking. Learning, which is essential in the architecture, is modelled as the development of a network of nodes (chunks) which are connected in various ways. This can be contrasted with Soar and ACT-R, two other cognitive architectures, which use productions for representing knowledge. CHREST has often been used to model learning using large corpora of stimuli representative of the domain, such as chess games for the simulation of chess expertise or child-directed speech for the simulation of children’s development of language. In this respect, the simulations carried out with CHREST have a flavor closer to those carried out with connectionist models than with traditional symbolic models.

##CLARION

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLARION_(cognitive_architecture)
https://github.com/development-team/2/blob/master/doc/analysis/artificial_consciousness.md#ron-suns-cognitive-architecture-clarion

CLARION is an integrative architecture, consisting of a number of distinct subsystems, with a dual representational structure in each subsystem (implicit versus explicit representations). Its subsystems include the action-centered subsystem, the non-action-centered subsystem, the motivational subsystem, and the meta-cognitive subsystem.

1. The role of the action-centered subsystem is to control actions;
1. The role of the non-action-centered subsystem is to maintain general knowledge;
1. The role of the motivational subsystem is to provide underlying motivations for perception, action, and cognition;
1. The role of the meta-cognitive subsystem is to monitor, direct, and modify the operations of all the other subsystems.

##DUAL

DUAL is a general cognitive architecture integrating the connectionist and symbolic approaches at the micro level. DUAL is based on decentralized representation and emergent computation. It was inspired by the Society of Mind idea proposed by Marvin Minsky but departs from the initial proposal in many ways. Computations in DUAL emerge from the interaction of many micro-agents each of which is hybrid symbolic/connectionist device. The agents exchange messages and activation via links that can be learnt and modified, they form coalitions which collectively represent concepts, episodes, and facts.
Several models have been developed on the basis of DUAL. These include: AMBR (a model of analogy-making and memory), JUDGEMAP (a model of judgment), PEAN (a model of perception), etc.
DUAL is developed by a team at the New Bulgarian University led by Boicho Kokinov. The second version was co-authored by Alexander Petrov. The third version is co-authored by Georgi Petkov and Ivan Vankov.

EPIC (Executive-Process/Interactive Control) is a cognitive architecture developed by Professors David E. Kieras and David E. Meyer at the University of Michigan.[1][2]
EPIC has components that emulate various parts of the human-information processing system. Among these components are tools for perceptual, cognitive, and motor processing. It has been especially useful for building cognitive models in the domain of Human computer interaction.[3]
Many features of EPIC's perceptual/motor capabilities have been later incorporated into the ACT-R, CLARION, and other cognitive architectures.

## FORR

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FORR

A FORR architecture has three components: a set of descriptives that describe the state of the problem, a tiered set of Advisors that are consulted in order to decide what action to perform, and a behavioral script that queries the Advisors and performs the action that they suggest.[2]

###Advisors

The Advisors are the set of rationales or heuristics for making a decision. They can be considered the procedural memory component of the architecture. Upon each new decision, Advisors are queried in order to decide which action to perform. Advisors never communicate with each other or learn on their own: they simply ask for information about the state of the problem stored in the form of descriptives, and make a suggestion based on that information. The Advisors are divided into three tiers, which are queried in the following order:

1. Tier 1: these Advisors are always right. If these suggest an action, that action is carried out immediately and the query ends. If they forbid an action, that action is removed from consideration. Otherwise, move to the next tier.
1. Tier 2: if one of these Advisors is triggered, it proposes a sub-problem, or an ordered set of actions, achieving a sub-goal in solving the overall problem (such as moving around one obstacle in a maze). If no tier 2 advisor is triggered, move to last tier.
1. Tier 3: these are all other rationales. They are not always right, but compete with each other. They vote on an action, and the highest-voted suggestion is performed. Different problem classes in the same domain will have different weights for the same Advisors, and the weights are developed from experience through learning algorithms.

###Descriptives

The declarative memory component of the architecture, the descriptives represent the state of the problem and are available to any Advisor.

###Behavioral script

The behavioral script queries each tier of Advisors sequentially. If a tier 1 Advisor suggests an action, the script performs the action. Otherwise, if a tier 2 Advisor is triggered, it means that a sub-problem has been encountered. A tier 1 Advisor guarantees that only one tier 2 Advisor is active at any time. If no tier 1 Advisor comments and no tier 2 Advisor is triggered, the behavioral script asks for suggestions or comments from all tier 3 Advisors and lets them vote. The script performs the action with the highest vote among all tier 3 advisors.

http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/sloman-aisb01.pdf

The main idea behind this architecture is that the mind is essentially two-dimensional. On the first dimension (displayed horizontally) information flows from perception, via processing/reasoning, to action. On the second dimension (vertically) information flows from reactive processes, via deliberate processes, to reflective processes. The information flows are bidirectional. Next to this tidy organization, it poses an alarm system, used for quick all-out responses of the entire system.

![general architecture](http://www.garfixia.nl/l/library/download/urn:uuid:32853997-e225-4ede-8d67-fd7ebe258120/H-CogAff.jpg?height=877&width=600&ext=.jpg)

However, two main features of layered architectures are missing in H-CogAff. In such an architecture two layers may only communicate to with each other if they directly adjoin. In H-CogAff all layers communicate directly with one another. Also, in a layered architecture, the upper layer is a more abstract version of the lower level. In H-CogAff the "upper" functions are not more abstract versions of the "lower" functions, they are very different from each other. Furthermore, besides the three layers, several other modules are used as well, and these are positioned next to the main layers, making it unclear to which layer, if any they belong.
