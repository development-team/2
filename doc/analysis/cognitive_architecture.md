##4CAPS

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4CAPS

Notably, 4CAPS differs from other architectures for its stress on the capacity constraints (that is, limited computational power), and the dynamic collaboration between different centers. In particular, according the Just and Varma,[1] 4CAPS is based on four characteristic assumptions:

1. Each cortical area can perform multiple cognitive functions
1. Each cortical area has a limited capacity of computational resources
1. The cortical network of regions that is responsible for carrying out a particular task changes dynamically as the regions' capacity resources are saturated.
1. Communications between cortical regions is also subject to specific constraints, similar to bandwidth limitations along information channels.

##ACT-R

There are two types of modules:
1. Perceptual-motor modules, which take care of the interface with the real world (i.e., with a simulation of the real world). The most well-developed perceptual-motor modules in ACT-R are the visual and the manual modules.
1. Memory modules. There are two kinds of memory modules in ACT-R:
  2. Declarative memory, consisting of facts such as Washington, D.C. is the capital of United States, France is a country in Europe, or 2+3=5
  2. Procedural memory, made of productions. Productions represent knowledge about how we do things: for instance, knowledge about how to type the letter "Q" on a keyboard, about how to drive, or about how to perform addition.

##CopyCat

Main features:

1. analogy is main mechanism of higher cognition
2. **slipnet** the associative network, built on pre-programmed concepts and their associations (a long-term memory);
3. **working area** (also called workspace, similar to blackboard systems); 
4. **coderack** (with the **codelets**); high-level perception emerges from the spreading activity of many independent processes, called codelets, running in parallel, competing or cooperating.

##DUAL

DUAL is a general cognitive architecture integrating the connectionist and symbolic approaches at the micro level. DUAL is based on decentralized representation and emergent computation. It was inspired by the Society of Mind idea proposed by Marvin Minsky but departs from the initial proposal in many ways. Computations in DUAL emerge from the interaction of many micro-agents each of which is hybrid symbolic/connectionist device. The agents exchange messages and activation via links that can be learnt and modified, they form coalitions which collectively represent concepts, episodes, and facts.
Several models have been developed on the basis of DUAL. These include: AMBR (a model of analogy-making and memory), JUDGEMAP (a model of judgment), PEAN (a model of perception), etc.
DUAL is developed by a team at the New Bulgarian University led by Boicho Kokinov. The second version was co-authored by Alexander Petrov. The third version is co-authored by Georgi Petkov and Ivan Vankov.
