## CopyCat

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycat_(software)

Main features:

1. analogy is main mechanism of higher cognition
2. **slipnet** the associative network, built on pre-programmed concepts and their associations (a long-term memory);
3. **working area** (also called workspace, similar to blackboard systems); 
4. **coderack** (with the **codelets**); high-level perception emerges from the spreading activity of many independent processes, called codelets, running in parallel, competing or cooperating.
